Hyper-specialized Bachelor's programs don't do anything for you.

""I don't think I want to go into counseling/therapy""

""I would love some years of handson experience in Clinical Psychology ""

Clinical psychology concerns diagnosis and treatment of psychopathology, i.e., mental disorder. It focuses primarily on ""severe"" variations, such as schizophrenia. That is not at all what you're talking about re: ""work environments.""

The piece you describe in work environments, i.e., working as a consultant or coach, organizational development via culture change, etc., is I-O psychology.

From what you're written, I do not think you know enough about psychology in general or IO in particular to make a good decision about this yet. Thus I would suggest reading this book before you do much of anything else: [https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Industrial-Organizational-Psychologist-Dennis-Doverspike/dp/113848069X/](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Industrial-Organizational-Psychologist-Dennis-Doverspike/dp/113848069X/)

I would definitely recommend not applying or enrolling in anything until you learn more about the field.

Further, I would recommend against a PsyD in your situation. I'm guessing you probably are also unaware that almost all high-quality IO PhD programs a) only charge tuition if you choose not to work for the university, which almost all PhD students do, and b) do not require an existing master's degree. 

Another consideration is that if you want to continue your C-suite role while remaining simultaneously enrolled in a graduate program, you are going to be limited to low- to mid-tier programs, which influences the quality of instruction and experience you get. If you want to limit yourself to online programs, this becomes a more complicated problem. It is similar to the tradeoff between an ""executive MBA"" versus a traditional MBA. That might be something you are okay with, but you should understand what you are choosing between before choosing.

I'm wondering if you could speak more about the creation of those IDPs, specifically whether that got vetted with the stakeholders or leadership prior to launch. Not making accusations or judgment, just trying to better understand the situation.

One common problem I've noticed in this area is that people really like to come up with SMART goals for the purpose of making it fit into the SMART format; but the goals themselves are ultimately unrealistic or still hard to achieve because the organization doesn't have the resources or affordances to actually let individuals pursue/complete those developmental paths.",1

The IDPs are aligned to 70:20:10 principle and SMART goals well. 

And you are absolutely correct about organisations' ability or encouragement to let these leader's pursue learning goals - this is an issue in some cases but even when these aspects are managed, there are still people who don't make enough/necessary progress.

How do I tackle this? What type of organisations, circumstances, or people get this right?",1_1

That sounds to me like the goals and end states of their IDP are set too high, which naturally happens when people put stuff down on paper, and want accomplishments to look more impressive than what meaningful growth would truly be. This happens especially when growth is tied to compensation. But even when compensation is not involved, the company needs to foster a culture of genuine growth at an individual pace, otherwise it will only create a climate of fear that not growing ""enough"" will lead to termination. 

Every organization struggles with training and keeping their employees on track. What makes it work for them are some common underlying factors like being goal-oriented, have proper documentation in place, and checking in more than once a year/quarterly. But at the end of the day, it's really up to the people to follow through. Many see training and IDP as a check-the-box activity in keep being employed, so even though it's their own development and growth, they are not as invested or enthusiastic about development as some of us are.

And if we're talking about senior leaderships, they're putting out so many fires on the job, that ""meeting their designated development areas"" just isn't at the top of their daily activities. Side note: It's really weird and can be frustrating sometimes, because many of them have no problem reading a whole pop psych book about ""leaders eat last"" or ""daring greatly to lead authentically"" and copying the 10 things they need to do or whatever, but won't do the actual thing of fostering their own leadership styles effectively and over time. 

It sounds like you folks already have a good infrastructure in place, so that's a huge plus already. You could try digging into realistic motivators and appropriate incentives, but also keep in mind that attrition in interest will also happen.",1_1_1

It's a very difficult condition to live with and to accommodate, but we need to try.

As an anecdotal answer, I did manage a staff member who was diagnosed with DPD at one point. It is exhausting, to put it mildly. This person had a crippling lack of self-confidence and tended to interpret very benign interactions as critical, both of which are very typical characteristics of DPD. I had to be very deliberate in my interactions and plan very carefully for any feedback conversations because of her tendency to catastrophize any constructive feedback. I also had to accept that she would want to run most any decision by me for my approval before moving forward, so delegation in general was tough to accomplish.

I will say for now that most core IO journals tend to be theory-oriented, i.e.,  what general kind of knowledge about organizations and the people in them do we gain as a result of this research, whereas what you are describing sounds more like ""here's a thing we did derived from existing literature and a test of whether it worked or not."" 

A thing you did derived from existing literature is frankly not very interesting to the typical IO journal, because it does not extend theory. It applies it. Applying theory is important but is not really what gets published in IO. That difference is actually a lot of what differentiates master's vs. Ph.D. level practice also - master's is about application of theory, whereas the PhD is about creation of theory, ideally so that it can later be applied. 

That said, depending on precisely what you did, you might have better luck in applied healthcare journals. The field you are applying these concepts into have a much greater intrinsic reason to care about how research from other fields applies in theirs, so they are probably more likely to publish it. Especially healthcare practitioner journals or trade magazines.

It is ironic that a field that considers itself applied, and some of the top journals have ""applied"" in the title, do not want to publish work that is seen as too applied. It is as if people feel if you could apply the findings, they are not contributing to the knowledge base. So we have a ""knowledge base"" that is only loosely tied to the real world.

If your intervention is based on existing IO theory and maybe extends it, you might have luck in a mainstream journal. If by theory, you just mean you based it on applied experience and maybe some findings, then IO journals might not see it as theoretical in the sense that IO uses the term. In that case a possible outlet to consider is Group and Organization Management that is trying to publish stuff that is more relevant and not just theoretical.",4

I agree with others that you should consider a master's.

It's possible that a master's would be enough for what you want to do, but you could get the master's and then decide.

Most people who are successful in applying to PhD programs apply to several - if not many - and ultimately do have to move for their PhD. We (a program much less selective than Rice) turn down lots of local folks (i.e., in our own state or one over) every year that seem that seem to think we're the natural ""next step"" for them because we're close to home.

She says that a PhD is not a means to an end, you do not do it because ""I want x,y,z"", more you do it because you feel very strongly in a particular area of something and want to become one of the few subject matter experts in a particular area. 

Taking on a PhD student is a big responsibility/commitment and these applications are as much a job application as it is a program application. They can not fire you as easily like they can at work and they need to feel that they are going to get as much out of you as you are out of them (current state of academia). 

So aside from the logistics of whether you are able to commit to working 50-60+ hour work weeks, I think I would ask the question of if you are going in with a curious mindset or a here is a topic area I'm passionate about, that may not align with any professors area of interest/expertise, asking them to step outside their comfort zone, while you aren't going to offer anything to their line of research, may be a hard sell for non-diploma mill programs. I've talked to people in Psych PhD programs (not IO but social psych) and some of these diploma mill programs are a fraction of the work that I did for my M.S, and I went to University of Baltimore, not exactly a prestigious program (our mascot is a Bee, lol). 

I'll give you my thesis experience as an example. I am really interested in cognitive/personality testing for athletes, especially professional athletes, the current system is archaic and I haven't seen the data, but would be shocked if it weren't discriminatory. The department head and his professor friend were very interested in that but the head is in his late 80's and wouldn't take on students, the sort of ""second in line"" professor only wants to do research if its in her area and will help her with her research, and the ""*younger""* professor was willing to take me on as her student but only if it aligned with her research area. So I had to decide, do I do a thesis or not? (it wasn't required). So I learned about an area that wasn't my initial interest, found it interesting enough, although I wouldn't consider it for an area for a dissertation, it's just not my passion. Although doing my thesis was far from ideal for many reasons, I am glad I did it, I learned a lot, grew as a writer and researcher. 

So aside from being qualified, I would just look at it this way, if you aren't willing to budge on your topic area, you may need to find a professor who's research aligns with your interests and try to apply for that program (may require a move). I am lucky in that I can find many things interesting, others are more narrow focused so it is all about finding the right fit for you. And as others said, getting a PhD is not the only option, and honestly, it could be the wrong option for what you are trying to accomplish. If you are not getting a PhD for the sake of the PhD but to accomplish another goal, you may not make it through the PhD, if you are taken on as a student in the first place.",4

One is that the poster will come ""untrimmed"" meaning there's a bit of leftover fabric around the edges of your poster. I recommend trimming (with scissors) down to about 0.5 inch of margin and then when mounting, folding the margin underneath and pinning through it. If you leave more than that, it bunches up weirdly.

Two is that I suggest bringing/acquiring more pushpins than you think you'll need. If you only four for the corners, you end up needing to stretch it out to make it flat in the middle, and it can create scalloping that looks sort of weird - a little like an hourglass shape. I found 8 (3 top, 3 bottom, 1 each side) is usually enough to make it look square, as long as you don't stretch it too hard.

(Here's [an example of a five pin approach](https://i0.wp.com/kmurphyphd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_6403.jpg?fit=%2C&amp;ssl=1) from a random blog, in which you can see some scalloping. You can also see the untrimmed bits on the top and bottom. Such things may also bother you less than they bother me. >#)",2_1_1

Before the pandemic, PwC released a report that 30-40% of all jobs would be automatable by 2040. From what I remember from the report, PwC didnt have any prediction whatsoever about LLMs, and like most of the world, was likely blindsided when ChatGPT was publicly released in November 2022.

If our timeline is 25 years from now, Id say most jobs will be automatable. Whether theyll actually be automated, it depends on factors that are bettered discussed by an economist. Specifically, how long will it take for economy of scale to kick in? We might be able to build humanoid robots by then, but will the cost have come down enough that theyll be cheaper than a human laborer in most situations?

My guess is that the only truly safe jobs in ~25 years are ones where a human needs to be legally responsible for what happens, such as very high level roles, ones where a human should not be replaced on moral or ethical grounds, such as police officers, ones that dont feel right to automate, like babysitting and teaching, and ones that pose an existential threat if automated, such as military command.

At the same time, all of those are at risk of being automated to some degree. A police force, for example, might decide to buy several of those robo-dogs in place of 1-2 police officers or the might might decide that some decision-making can be done to AI, just as long as big ones like pressing the button are left to humans.

Its worth mentioning that by in the 2040s, Ray Kuzweil, a notable writer on the subject or total wackjob, depending on who you ask, believes that well have artificial general intelligence (AGI). That is, well have developed, at least behind closed doors, an AI that can perform ANY intellectual task that a human perform. It remains to be seen how that will actually play out, but even if you think hes a lunatic, its hard to argue that we wont be making huge strides in AI and automation.

As for where that leaves us, I say all of that to say exactly what the other person here said: Oh 100%.",1

I attended a conference last year for an applicant tracking system that had a ChatGPT-like software built into it. One of the panelists was an EEOC representative. He explained in plain words and with zero ambiguity that if you use an automation software in hiring, you are legally responsible for whatever that automation software does. If your automation software unintentionally (or ""unintentionally"") discriminates against a protected class, it's you the human that has to answer to Uncle Sam, not ChatGPT.

For similar reasons, you can expect certain human resource and talent acquisition roles to remain human. Even if you automated parts of your human resource or talent acquisition processes, you *must* ultimately have a human at the wheel. There are probably companies right now that have automated significant parts of their human resources and talent acquisition processes, but I'm sure most are very afraid of becoming the company that ends up on the nightly news because their automation software mass-discriminated against a protected class.

I'm sure that'll change in \~25 years when AI and automated are much better than today, but at the moment, roles that need to make decisions that brush up against the law are safe.",1_1

It's not only a question of how quickly the AI tech is developed. The more important question is what AI tech will end up being widely adopted once it is developed. Using chatGPT as an example, the LLM that powered the original version of chatGPT (gpt-3) in Nov 2022 was developed over two years prior. NLP researchers had been well aware of the potential of LLMs like gpt for years. It wasn't until 2 years later when OpenAI slapped a cute user interface on it in the form of chatGPT that this LLM tech became influential. It wasn't a tech development breakthrough, it was a marketing breakthrough. Arguably, the marketing of the AI tech is a better predictor of whether it will be widely implemented than the utility of the AI tech itself.

LLMs have a lot of mundane applications that, while not too gamechanging on their own, add up and will significantly reduce the amount of people required in certain roles.

You don't need a particularly ""smart"" or ""intelligent"" machine to read customer support scripts or do entry-level administrative work. LLMs, at present and with no further advances, will likely have a huge impact on these jobs. There are companies *right now* with software that replaces a lot of what entry-level admins do.

To put some data on this since we're a science-focused subreddit, some of the largest occupations are ones that are at-risk by this technology specifically. Entry-level admin assistants, office clerks, customer service representatives, and similar non-degree requiring desk jobs make up around 10% of America's workforce. While not all of them are going to be automated away overnight, it's fair to call a technology that endangers that many jobs to be a gamechanger, even if it's not quite ready yet.

Please feel free to DM if you have questions after reading below. Best of luck to you :) 

I feel 2 business majors would allow better entry-level opportunities for me rather than one psych and one business.  I disagree. MANY choose to double major in two business disciplines. Having psych and business together stands out more imo. Additionally, applicants are so much more than their degrees. ANYONE can go to class, get good grades, and get a degree. Its those out-of-class, real-world experiences that make a difference. Think internships, work experience, personal entrepreneurial endeavors, etc.  those are what you need to be considered for quality entry-level roles at well-known companies. If I were you, I would do 1 psych and 1 business as long as it wont delay your graduation or put you in a bad place financially. You said you go to a large state school  if thats the case, Psych is likely housed within a different college within your university than Business, and wont have double course credit rules. This could mean an additional year to complete the degree, and additional costs. Talk with your academic advisor or counselor to map out a couple different degree paths, the years to complete, and the cost.

if I do decide to complete 2 business majors only, is it still possible for me to get into a good I/O grad program without too much psychological undergraduate research?  This depends on your career aspirations and the associated level of grad school you would need to go to. From my understanding as Im going through the grad school research and application process now, the traditional Master of Science in IO Psychology (MSIOP) programs are going to require (or at least strongly prefer) a Psych degree as they are designed to prep you for a PhD so you can work in a university or research setting. However, there are options for applied programs in IO that are more focused prepping you to work within a corporation and may not qualify you to go on for a PhD.

How do people who graduate with an unrelated bachelor's degree enter grad school for I/O psych, since they do not have undergraduate research (which l've heard is extremely important)?  When you say unrelated bachelors degree, Im assuming you just mean non-Psych bachelors degree. In my case, I graduated with an Honors BBA in Human Resources Management with minors in Psychology and Information Systems last year. I had no IO research experience and I currently work full-time in HR. Im about to submit my application for an APPLIED program tailored to working professionals not explicitly designed to lead to a PhD. But note that even this applied program is asking for a Research Methods course as a prerequisite  something youre not going to get if you skip out on a Psych major. (Im having to write a supplemental to explain why I dont have a Research Methods course and detail other relevant courses or work experiences that might qualify me by exception)

which 2 majors within business would set me up for success  Again, if I were you, I would do 1 psych and 1 business. Im surprised you didnt list HR as a potential business major (maybe your school doesnt offer it?). That would probably be the closest business major to I/O Psych. You listed a wide array of potential areas of interest beyond IO Psych all with different business focuses. Maybe try to narrow down those interests.",4

Adding Human Resources and Organizational Behavior courses from the business school/program will likely introduce you to some foundational IO concepts like selection, training and development, job analysis, and competency modeling. I think that often other classes listed as applied behavioral science or organizational science will also have IO related content, but that really depends on your school. This might be a stretch, because it really depends if these paths are available through your school but doing a practicum course in HR or LD could be really beneficial for both grad school and the field, working in a campus lab doing research related to learning is likely also useful to get experience for grad school. Generally though, I think IO programs know that theres a huge range of the exposure undergrads have to IO and the opportunities they have to take IO related content before grad school, so theyll likely interpret your application and experiences with that in mind.

That said, most faculties would not be happy to see you stretch things out because universities track time to degree.

My advice to most people would be to get it over with as quick as possible so you can start working in an IO job, and therefore pay less tuition. An alternative is to complete the program part-time while working for an employer with a tuition reimbursement program so you're not paying for school.

I'd still prefer the first option, but the alternative can be good if you're on a tight budget or you really like the organization you're working for and can stick it out there for a few years while you're getting your degree.

I imagine if your degree was actually a ""Master's of IO Psychology,"" you'd get the psychology color like PsyDs do, which is a different darker gold.

I ended up disclosing my planned side venture to my CHRO and our general counsel, out of caution. They reacted with some apprehension to the ideathinking it was odd that Id consult in my same wheelhouse in which I work full-time which I disagreed with but didnt argue back. I definitely bitterly thought to myself: I paid tens of thousands of dollars for my education. Of course I would consult in my domain of expertise&? What am I going to do on the side? Design custom gnome houses?

They eventually came to an agreement with each other and me that I could start my side business in the same area as long as I didnt use company time or intellectual property. Of course, that was a no-brainer. 

My takeaways: 

- Scrutinize your employee handbook before you ask your employer about potential conflicts of interestbe on the lookout for any outside work policy. 

- If there is no outside work policy, you have the option to be bullish in throwing caution to the wind and not disclosing to your employer you have an I/O-related side gig. Barring a policy like this, you can argue that there was absolutely no conflict of you doing whatever on your own personal time as long as you didnt cause your FT employer any damages or steal their time or intellectual property.

- I chose to be bearish in realizing we had no outside work policy but I still disclosed my planned side venture. I was extra cautious to root out any possible conflict of interest. I also wanted to both appear and genuinely be above-board and transparent to my employer. I wouldnt have wanted to be discovered by them as having a side gig and then find out on the backend that this was a problem and I was being sneaky.

- The bearish approach worked for me in this instance. Im not in trouble with my FT employer and Ive received their blessing of my side gig after they gave it some thought. Ill admit I dont know the longer-term political ramifications of my decision to disclose to the CHRO and legal. They may think Im now a flight risk or Im disloyal in some way for pursuing part-time side consulting.",4

Not saying its impossible though, but I think you will definitely want to develop a unique selling point (I think hard skills such as data analysis and coding languages are a good idea) and gain some experience. It will be close to impossible after recently graduating.

Therefor I would recommend you focus on finding a job in NL after graduating. The road to citizenship or permanent residence is not that long after that (if any of those are of interest to you). The Netherlands will be a good option for you because of a few reasons:

1. Because you graduate from a NL University, the visa requirements for minimum salary are dropped and you have one year to find work after graduating. Other EU countries will still require you meet certain minimum salary requirements to give you a visa, and they can sometimes be unattainable for entry level positions. 

2. Very low unemployment rate. Many of the foreign non EU non STEM students that I have been in touch with have had several job offers on graduation 

3. Liberal immigration laws. Many of the candidates that I have recruited after graduation have gone on to be naturalised citizens or get permanent residence within a certain time frame. After you do that, Europe is your playground and your access to opportunities will increase :) 

4. Language wise, despite not being an English speaking country, the Netherlands has extremely high English literacy and it is very possible to find work there without speaking professional level Dutch. 

I order to attain citizenship or permanent residence you will need to learn a basic level of Dutch. However, it is quite attainable and if you put in some hours every week when you start your first year of university you should be more than there by the time you graduate. Learning another language than Dutch will most likely not bring you any benefits, because it won't impact the visa regulations. Also it will be hard to master the language of a country you do not live in. So focus on Dutch! 

After you have gotten permanent residence (and the access to opportunities that comes with it, which after all, is a great fallback and safety to have) and gained some 4-5+ years of experience, you could consider opportunities in the US. Even then as an IO psychology background it will be hard, the only way I see is with very decent hard skills in data analytics and coding. But by that time, there is nothing in the way of trying. 

Whereas if you haven't attained your European permanent residence yet, going to the US will be a gamble for you. Employment laws are lax there. People are being laid of frequently. As an immigrant, being laid of means you gotta pack your bags and leave immediately.

Regarding the NL, I mentioned many reasons why it's a good choice, but one thing to monitor out for is the current government and the impact they might have on immigration policy. Other than that, don't be put off by the political discourse though, people in the NL are very open and friendly. 

Best of luck and hope you enjoy your stay in Europe!

* Associate analyst - $45k-$65k
* Analyst - $60k-$80k
* Sr Analyst - $70k-$95k

* This seems like a really convoluted exercise.

* You mention speed in the title, but I don't see you discuss it. Usually speededness is an important characteristic that has a lot of literature around, it needs to be accounted in construct scoring.

The company I work for uses a vendor who designed an assessment for a call center role with a similar multitasking component. The candidate listens to an audio recording of a fake customer calling with information about their bill. The candidate has to fill in what the customer is saying. The distractor is a button they have to press when a customer satisfaction number in the corner of the screen goes under 90%. The candidate's speed to press the button is accounted for in their score (i.e., if they fail to press it or take too long, it dings them). Even if I knew how they weighted their items, I couldn't share, that's their proprietary work. I also can't imagine how you'd build that in your ATS, that sounds like a **major** PITA. 

For compliance, anyone with a disability who can't complete the assessment simply bypasses the assessment entirely and goes to the next stage in the recruiting process. The technology doesn't have an ADA compliant alternative.",2

It's still structured. There could be a set of learning objectives at the beginning, and a list of To-Do's and Parking Lot items. You can still dedicate a portion to guided small groups and plenary discussions. What will actually encourage those discussions would be the very targeted prompts and/or specific instructions that you've crafted. It also helps if those exercises incorporate something physical (e.g., get out of the seat to put sticker dots on a set of options, write ideas on post-it notes and have them group it into similar concepts, present contributions on large stick pads and do a gallery walk to share every groups ideas, etc.) I've also seen way better facilitators who can just engage the participants directly, so it's not just passive listening and going along with the exercises.",2

While it's working with people they are drastically different in training (i.e. licensure) and approach.

If you got a master's in clinical psychology or related degree (to be a therapist) jobs will likely be easier to get immediately wether it's a non-profit or other agency.

Masters in IO can be difficult to find an immediate job in, even in HR without the work experience. But when you start to get experience it gets easier and salary is often better.

My background to help you out. BA in psych, minor in philosophy led me to being a crisis counselor in various programs (crisis unit, state crisis line, at a school and other residential program) then to quality assurance in the same agency I was a crisis counselor. From there I got an MSIOP got a new job (different agency) that focuses on outreach for medical facilities to assess and support training on behavioral health.

I agree with other posts on looking in yourself to understand if you want to be in a clinical or business setting as both have their perks and drawbacks. 

After getting my BS in psych, I went off and found employment in various roles, including crisis counseling, outreach, substance abuse counseling, and psychoeducation. I quickly found that I did not enjoy the clinical setting but liked the idea of using psychological science to find solutions to problems. This is what drew me to the IO field, and I enjoyed every bit of grad school (minus the chaotic schedule of working full time and going to classes). 

If you enjoy the idea of going into an organization; understanding how business is conducted through interviews, large group interventions, and assessments; formulating a plan of attack to address deficiencies/training issues/work-life balance...

2. Applied vs Academic. Depending on your career aspirations, the ranking may or may not matter. Others have weighed in on this, so I wont belabor the point.
3. Faculty Fit. Your PhD track is yours. You own it. So, pick a program with faculty that have research interests, publications, and connections that align with your PhD topic.

Everything you are describing is master's type stuff. Going into an organization, being given specific projects to complete, working on teams to address specific issues a company is facing, etc., it all bread and butter HR. An IO master's will give you a different perspective on HR than people with an HR MBA will get, and that can be useful in that situation, if you are capable and if you were trained well.

That is not really the career path for a PhD. A PhD is a degree in research. You are learning how to ask and answer questions more meaningfully, to better understand truth. There are some organizational contexts where that's useful, and there are some where that's not. If you want a career where the work is essentially just ""solving cases"" like ""management has cut the budget for benefits, so how should we modify offer letters and what other documentation sent to employees needs to change?"", you don't need a PhD for that.

Where a PhD helps is in meaningfully tackling the big, important, ambiguous questions. ""How do we solve the DEI problem in our organization?"" That has hundreds of components, thousands of little trade offs depending how you define the problem, what tools you have to address it, what resources you can pull from, what buy in you have from the organization, what access you have to employees, and on and on and on. PhD training is about building skill in breaking down complex, hard problems into smaller, addressable ones, and being confident that you really learned something in doing so. A PhD in IO is even more specifically using the tools of science to accomplish this.

I think the biggest indicator of whether you want a PhD is whether your reaction to that idea is ""research sounds like a lot of work"" versus ""research sounds like something I could get really excited about and lost in."" I think you can guess which is the PhD signal!

As for a very practical answer: something like 75-85% of PhD graduates even from ""top"" PhD program go into practice. Academic careers are far more uncommon. So most people get a PhD *not* intending to become professors.

Further, like /u/NFC818231 wrote, almost all good PhD programs offer students both a salary for working as a teaching assistant while there and also pay their tuition to attend, so you don't generally pay anything out of pocket for a PhD other than your time. Needing to pay for tuition in a PhD program in IO is *usually* a signal that it is taught more like a more-difficult master's program, so the benefits of training are more similar to those getting a master's degree but cost students significantly more. I would generally suggest not undertaking that kind of PhD. There are some exceptions to this, but a general rule, that kind of program is a much riskier choice.",1

1) Not all PhD programs grant a master's along the way.

2) Those that do grant a master's generally provide very different training than a ""terminal"" master's program (i.e., that's the ""last"" degree in you earn in that program). In a terminal master's program, the faculty *know* you are aiming to be done in a specified time that is much shorter than a typical PhD. Courses are planned accordingly. They are also usually much more applied-focused. PhDs make no such assumption and are going to emphasize research skills first and foremost. For example, I expect my students to be involved in my research lab starting their very first semester. I am much more concerned about their research involvement than classes because the point of a PhD is research. It's a very different experience.

3) Professional development opportunity will be different. In a PhD, professional development is catered to students who will ultimately have PhDs. So we're not giving out advice for those that will have a master's; we're only speaking to students we assume will have a PhD. Our alumni network, speakers, etc. typically all have PhDs, who have different jobs available to them than those that only have a master's. So you're also plugging into the wrong network. If you just want a master's, you should go to a master's program. The alumni network will also all be people with master's degrees.

4) ""Mastering out"" (i.e., leaving once you have a master's) in most IO PhD programs in the U.S. is an escape hatch for students who are on pace to fail out of the PhD or change their minds for some reason. It's generally NOT a first choice.

5) You are taking a spot from someone who wants a PhD, and you are taking up funding, time, and energy from a professor who is expecting to invest a lot upfront to build skills. PhD students are a lot of work on the faculty's end, and often we have to work to find funding for you, too (e.g., through a grant). I don't want to invest a bunch of energy and literal money training research skills in someone who never had any intent to use them. (Again, because jobs you can get with a master's degree don't usually emphasize research skills.)

6) If they find out you enrolled with no intent of actually getting a PhD, the people in your program will not be happy. This is a problem because your program is often your most important network, they provide references, etc.

There are some funded master's programs. If funding is important to you, just target those.",2_1

2. If you work, start observing whats taking place and try to figure out how things got that way (good or bad). Start with a manager. Why do you think they are effective or ineffective? Focus on behaviors- just what you can observe. You can do it for a teacher or coach if you dont work.

If you cant find psych research, any research is better than none. Small liberal arts colleges sometimes have good undergrad research programs and sometimes do not.

You should find this out before attending, as this is a difficult issue to fix if your school just doesnt have any research involvement opportunities.

If/when you attend, try to take your first psych courses in for first semester, and try to get involved in research your second year (or even first year, if your classes are going well). You will get the best info on how to do that by talking to your psych instructors. But this usually involves either volunteering your time every week in a lab or taking some type of research experience class.

I dont know what HUMMS and GAS are, but a background in STEM is certainly relevant to IO and also doesnt hurt no matter what career you ultimately end up in! 

Third, an entry level education for IO is a masters degree, so youre around a decade away from1 that. So dont worry about the specifics just yet! For now, just focus on getting as much exposure as you can to science, math, and psychology.",1

The most important thing to consider I think when  looking at IO grad programs is: would they teach you the skills you need to be competitive on the job market? 

Think of it this way. If you went to a 1-year program to try to get out as quickly as possible, you're going to be in competition with those who probably took a lot more classes and spent more time studying and refining their skills in a 2-year program.

A lot of those articles about how IO is a growing field are a few years old. The reality of today is that it is really rough out there, especially for new grads.",1

It is unique for every school pairing (each community college has negotiated relationships with individual 4 year colleges and unis, usually local), so you should not use Reddit to figure out the answer.

There should be some kind of transfer specialist office in your community college that can give you a straight answer on which schools your courses will transfer to within any college systems you are considering. There might also be a web based app. You need to figure out who the person/office is in the community college and ask them this question.

(Also: the specific degree titles, arts vs sciences, are essentially meaningless. You need to know about individual course/credit transferability and how that relates to specific degree requirements in the 4 year).",1

I'll add that it's typically easier to transfer a full Associates than individual credits, but it's pretty much guaranteed that if you go for a Bachelors, any university will likely make you pay for some extra stuff. Basic math, phys ed, meal plans, and/or force you into dorms for no reason other than milking you for everything they can.

Regarding the specialist comment, don't take what they say as the full truth. They do their best to inform you but there is an unreal amount of red tape designed to get you to pay for a few extra credits/housing/meal plans. One of my friends went through this a few years ago.

Silver lining, this route is still cheaper than getting a full 4 years so it's still a smart move.

I have an MA in industrial/organizational psychology. I work for the government in Canada managing an office that does projects. I've also worked in policy and briefly research. 

Day to day varies, I have project meetings, briefings with executives, sometimes HR activities like interviews, payroll administration, work on things like improving processes and practices in the organization. 

My start was in research with the government on transportation. That stemmed from research and consulting experience gained in my degree, we had an HR consulting internship. But the really valuable skill was applied research and how to apply data and evidence to solve problems. Those skills are transferable to questions like how to quantitatively analyze and ground policy recommendations, or how to effectively run an interview or motivate employees. 

I use the lessons learned in IO regularly. A couple weeks back, a conversation with my boss's boss turned to burnout and how to reduce it among the division. I mentioned research of giving staff more resources, like better technology, and reducing demands, like say pausing non-corr work, has been shown to reduce burnout (the job demands resources model). They loved it and want a discussion session with ~40 managers across the division.

Plus, I only completed my Master's this past May and I'm already working outside of the traditional I/O industry. I'm not a consultant and I don't work in HR. The company I did my internship with didn't want to hire me full time and I couldn't find a single job in our field. My education is coming in handy in my current role, but it is not what I directly prepared myself for when getting my degree. 

My vote for you would be school psychologist based on what you've said in your post, but only you can truly answer this question. Focus on what you're passionate about and what you find rewarding. School psychologists can still make great money without having to work a traditionally very corporate job and you're helping children pursue their education. Pretty rewarding if you ask me.",3

If it's short, then just start applying and then put your school that you've been accepted in your resume and you'll be alright (e.g. MSU MS IOPSYC est. 2026)

3. Find some papers on these topicsideally, systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Look at how they operationalise your variables of interest. Find some of the more interesting pieces of research from said review papers, and read them. See how they design the research. Google anything you don't understand.

An interesting tidbit about the temp employee/contracting world is that an agencys bill rate to their client is quite a bit higher than what youre being paid as a temp.  An industry standard for conversion is a certain percentage of whatever salary youre being offered by the company looking to bring you aboard full time.

This next part is entirely an opinion, but its coming from experience from the agency side of things: your offered salary is a calculated lowball so the fee they are on the hook to pay to the temp agency is lower.

From a hygiene perspective, having good or cordial working relationships is a minimally acceptable condition. In the absence of this, you're left feeling alienated and part of the out-group. This is tantamount to merely being treated with dignity and could have nothing to do with your work. 

However, from a motivator perspective, feeling valued is akin to being recognized for your hard work, unique strengths, etc. While there's obviously an interpersonal component to this, the framing of it is somewhat different such that it is more around being valued for your work and contributions. The absence of this may not immediately be a dealbreaker, but leaders who do this effectively end up with very engaged employees.

Hope that helps parse things out a little bit. It's also important to remember that Herzberg's Theory is just that: a theory. The dichotomy is intuitively appealing, but reality is never that straightforward.",2

However, the nature of their interaction is not all that relevant for the theory. The crux of the issue is whether or not people have the right hygiene factors to set a baseline (let's say these are the determinants of -10 to 0 motivation). And then have the right motivational factors to capitalise on that baseline (let's say this takes motivation from 0 to +10). 

The theory treats it as a spectrum with no hierarchy. Although we can postulate that there is a hierarchy a priori based on the concepts and some other related research in the field. E.g., if someone feels valued at work, have awesome achievements and have great recognition, a single harassment incident may decrease their motivation totally to -10 despite all these positives. 

However, trying to find moderating/mediating relationships among the factors is something you'd have organised in your research design beforehand. And you'd likely use a more intricate model like JD-R. Herzberg's theory is simple and I'd leave the analysis to be simple:

* You have relationships, which mitigates demotivation; people are bonding and relating to one anther. There is a flow of communication. It's neutral. 
* and you have feelings of being valued, which increases motivation. People are bonding, relating, but also increasing the positive valence of their communication.",3

To me, software engineering is more of a technical career trajectory and you already articulated the reasons why.

In many career ladders, theres a much more ambiguous track and Ive found that navigating it takes a high level of protectiveness and risk tolerance.

I am not a software engineer, but I do work in tech!

I wasn't really asking the question so I could ""level up"" or that I would want to become a manager per se. I am looking to learn more about what could make this process better in a way by learning more about IO psychology to understand what helps employees and managers in general.

------

The current situation that I see (at least in tech):

1. Usually there are 1-on-1 conversations with managers. Can have performance review sessions as you have mentioned as well

2. In meeting with managers, it can happen that the employee doesn't know what to talk about and it can also be that the manager doesn't really know what to talk about either.

3. Lot of times it is unknown what is needed to get to ""level up"" - eg if someone wants to go from a level 3 engineer to a level 4, or to an engineer manager role (engineering is just an example of course, it could be applied to any other type of roles - but I am mostly interested in the tech field atm). 

4. Lots of times if someone wants to ""level up"", they need to submit some kind of request and then they might get reviewed at that point - but people need to be pretty proactive about it.

5. When employees are getting reviewed for promotion, it can be a bit random as there are no set skills or clear documentations on the employees performance

-----

What I see as example solutions:

1. Lots of companies have some Career Development Framework set, where they write out different skillsets that are needed for different positions and levels, so employees know what they need to do

3. Softwares out there like Lattice, Leapsome, or [Progression.xyz](http://Progression.xyz) that supposed to help people get promoted - Clearer way to see what ""skills"" the employee needs to achieve; space for 1-on-1 meeting notes; place for managers to give praises &amp; rate employees - I guess this is a type of reinforcement. On the managers and HR's side: see how each employee is performing and who to promote next.

4. Employees would come up with more actionable items with their managers in meetings to accomplish the different target skills they need.

5. The softwares also help to try employees and managers discuss things related to help employees improve themselves in and outside of the workplace and reach their goals through offering some prompts.

---  
For me, something just feels off about these softwares. I know employees dont love it and don't see too much of a benefit of it. I would like to understand why and be able to pinpoint my problems with these more.

So I basically was just asking for books / papers / podcasts / any other source that could help me learn more about:

1. If my feelings about these softwares are right or wrong and how  
2. What can really help employees to know how to level up better  
3. What can really help companies to know who to level up

I want to understand more about why these softwares fail (lots of employees have not been loving them), and how they could be made better.",1_1

It turned out that in that clinical project I learned factor analysis and SEM skills which are super relevant to I-Os who do individual differences research.

The biggest tip I could give in addition to this is look up applications to roles you might like in the private industry. Use chat gpt to get reccomendations based on your resume for good job titles that would transfer nicely by asking it what jobs would be good based on your resume. You can then look at postings to find what skills to need to gain, and also what to tailer your resume to add to even if the posting does not include that information. For example, if posting A and posting B said you need skills in software 1 and 2. Get those skills and add both to your resume. Also make sure to network with folks who are at companies you are interested in using Linkedin. References from employees boost your application chances of being looked at by a real person. You can also take the opportunity to talk to them about their positon, maybe shadow what they do, and asking how they like it.",2_1_1

Among my friends who went applied with a PhD, precisely 1 of about a dozen are still research-active. As in, they publish research for academic outlets despite them having an applied job. About half of the others use their skills in jobs that would resemble research, but the findings are not published or published as things like white papers and not in traditional academic outlets. The rest, like myself, may do the occasional SIOP piece, but we are largely uninterested in research the way that academics would be.

For applied research, my general experience is that the research is far less about the technical stuff like stats (which is still important, but almost secondary). Its much more about how it translates to business needs. In that sense, its much more problem-specific and less abstract. Nobody cared as much about percent variance explained or which theoretical model outperformed the other by 2%. Its more what kind of story does the data tell that is of interest to business. 

You do lose a bit of rigor I would say, though that is more due to condition than fault of the applied folks. Business data is seldom clean but an answer is expected anyways. There is far more ad-hoc stuff than planned out experimental groups. Theres also a need to make it easier for non-experts to consume, so letting go of technical nuances is sometimes necessary.

my lit reviews are a lot shorter, im really just looking for examples of a similar approach or guidance on an element of the model, and theyre informal, mostly just an annotated bib that few see other than me and one or two technical people who get curious.

data collection comes in the form of mostly querying through archival data stored in loads of sql tables, scouring internal documentation, tracing pipelines to make sure you know what the data is, then figuring out a way to preprocess it all to something malleable.

i dont write an academic style paper. instead i write 2-3 papers for different audiences to market the capabilities internally. one shorter with pretty visualizations and whatnot (hate that apa style discourages the use and styling of graphs), and one for a technical audience that explains the methods and links them to different parts of the project

academic research is about discovering something, practical research is about that too in some roles, but can also be inventing a new process or capability, and then providing metrics that show its usefulness.

Since this will likely be dummy coded by your stats software, the reference level will be absorbed in the intercept of the model, e.g., the mean for that reference level would be the intercept. Each other level will have it's own coefficient, which indicates the difference between that level and the reference level (if you think of the linear model, y\_i = a + Bx\_i, that intercept a would be for the reference level. Each other level would have a coefficient that would be ""activated"" if the row was that tutor. Then the sum of a and that coefficient would be the mean for that level/tutor). This way you would be able to see if any tutors were more or less effective than the others.   


Dealing with the multiple tests could be done a couple of ways. The fact that it seems students could change tutors makes it more difficult - otherwise you could just include a time component as a variable. Since they can change between different tests, what you could do is have each row be the difference between one test and the test after it for a particular student, and record the tutor for that period. Since we are observing the improvement in score (really the difference in score, since scores can go down), it wouldn't matter to the model that a student switched tutors - we would still have a value for the difference in score from the tests before and after tutoring with the new teacher, and we would know the teacher, so we would be able to see the impact of studying with that teacher on the student's score change. Ideally you would still also have a variable for time, since there's likely a difference between studying with a teacher for one day vs one month between tests. Hopefully this gave you some ideas!",2

&gt; Reducing academic performance to a single number (GPA) assumes that academic performance is unidimensional. Academic performance is probably multidimensional, although im not sure what those dimensions might be

GPA is averaged across different courses though - each course is presumably graded to its own ""dimension."" What constitutes an A in math is different than gym class (we won't touch on *g* in this convo). Even if you invent a completely new set of ways to grade people, it will still be summarized at some point. We can establish some objective ways to weigh some courses more than others, but I can already see that being an inevitable firestorm for students who performs less well in math than say PE. The only way to make that number less 'unfair' is to then introduce after that more human subjectivity, which I argue has traditionally made assessment tools more inaccurate on average, not less. 

&gt; GPA is mostly used as a selection tool to decide who gets into college (or grad school). 

No university uses only GPA as a sole determiner though. It's more of a screen-out than a screen-in, and I would argue that's a fair use case. A student who struggles to get a C average in high school (2.0), regardless of why, would just as likely struggle to maintain grades in university, no?

&gt; It is almost useless as a development tool and a more comprehensive measure of academic performance could give students better insight into how they could improve.

I don't think it's meant to be a developmental tool though. The development is happening during coursework, not the end when you're assigned the final grade. You can argue that a grade is insufficient at capturing growth or progress, being that it is a static snapshot. In that sense, it is a weakness of the tool. But this is why students also do additional things like personal statements, records of other activities, testimonials, etc. Admins are aware of and do take into account that a select few students with subpar scores have compelling justifications. But the truth is, the majority probably don't. 

&gt; Obvious reliability concerns. Grading standards vary between schools, courses, and instructors.

I don't have any numbers pulled up, but I have to imagine SAT scores are correlated with GPA. Noise caused by subjective bias is certainly a relevant criticism, though school administration likely account for that by treating a 4.0 from an elite school differently than a poor county school (this is done indirectly through zip code). 

&gt; Since any score 90% or above gets an A (4.0), GPA is almost useless for distinguishing high performing students. At the other end, all low scorers (below 60%) receive 0 grade points, so GPA is useless for distinguishing low scorers as well.

This returns to my point about it being a screening tool. You don't need to distinguish between high-performing students because the goal isn't to judge who the 91st or 99th percentile student is. It's essentially banding where all students above a certain cutoff are likely to be successful. Universities are playing the odds across the entire incoming student body, the way that a casino profits across the entire customer base knowing that the odds are on their side, even if the occasional gambler walks away with money. Once you're through the door, your GPA no longer matters anyways, you become a loaded dice roll from the university's perspective. 

On the other end, lumping everyone below 60% as a fail-case is to say that the odds any of them succeed are so low it doesn't justify using a gradient. It can seem exclusionary, but we accept this with physical things like sports where if you're less than 6 ft tall, you most likely don't have any shot at a college basketball scholarship (probably more like 6'2""). There's no point in distinguishing between 5'4"" from 5'6"" from 5'8"" or 5'10"", where roughly half the population stands, because odds are good none of them can make it for basketball. I have no doubt there are some amazing players that are short, just as there are some students who would excel coming in with a really low GPA (like below 2.0). But given the cost of entry, since they will likely have no scholarship, and given the lower odds, schools would probably rightly offer their limited space to those they deem more likely to succeed. This goes beyond just GPA as a measurement, but there's also just a business reality of why we care to measure it at all. 

&gt; I would love for an alternative to GPA to be developed and implemented nationally.

If we're focused on academic education only, I don't truly think you'd deviate too far from GPA. The other extreme I'd argue is a demonstration, which would be a test a la SATs, and people hate that just as much (GPA you can at least show growth over time or have a variety of things to balance out your worst courses). People just seem to hate being measured in general. But schools need a way for students to demonstrate they have the desired skillset. So if GPA is out, where students demo that they can do coursework, and competence through a test is out, what is left? Do we just take students at their word that despite not having demonstrated competency in academic performance before, things will be different once they cross into college?

That leads to a counter-problem, that when schools let poor-performing students in, they are insufficiently prepared/skilled and fail. They lose time and resources, in addition to the negativity that comes with failing. I'm not sure that's any better, especially if we consider how pervasive student loans are in society, at least in the US. 

If you want to make GPA a tool for development instead, I'd argue that should be captured by coursework. And coursework does try. Students often take multiple tests to demonstrate their grasp of materials throughout the course, with each test building cumulatively on prior knowledge. And one way to weight progress is to give later tests higher weight than earlier ones, which is essentially the difference between homework being weighed the least, followed by the periodic quizzes, and the summary tests. But students hate that too.  

If you're trying to tackle social issues about access and fairness, I think it has to happen much earlier than GPA and university. It's probably to nudge people who aren't stellar students from wanting to pursue higher education out-of-pocket. In that regard, GPA serves as an early diagnostic - if for whatever reason you simply can't maintain a C average across all sorts of classes, foundational classes you're likely to need to retake in college, odds are good you'll struggle there as well. Perhaps the trades or an apprenticeship is a much better choice. 

A diagnostic tool doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be much better than chance. I'm certainly not suggesting GPA as be-all and end-all (and it hasn't been for a long time now). I understand the inherent impulse to not measure people up because there will inevitably be better and worse. But ""holistic measures"" are not any less flawed. You're just asking humans to sort people by a non-verbalized ""GPA"" of their own choosing.",1

R proficiency sets you up nicely for the technical side necessary to break into the field. In my experience, people data is typically unstructured with HR leaders who don't have much familiarity with data integrity, structure, and metrics/KPIs -- People Analytics is responsible for bridging this gap. 

Depending on the maturity level of People Analytics within a given organization, your work could focus on setting up the foundations for analytics and reporting (ETL and ownership of people data and programs). In my case, I'm the sole analytics person of an HR department of 80+ for an organization that's &lt;10 years old, so I'm in the phase of establishing data integrity and reporting. I work with data engineers, product managers, finance to provide analytics, as well as some fun internal analytics projects. I use data warehouses to query data to provide automated dashboards, and knowing how to extract, clean, and visualize data (SQL and PowerBI/Tableau) is important to the role. Not saying this is all you'll do, as obviously analytics is in the name -- but the business need will always be foundational, reportable data first which opens the door for analytics. There's certainly the opportunity for advanced stats projects, but most of the time, business leaders are looking for improvements in descriptive stats/metrics.

In more mature organizations, you could work on a team that's working with data scientists and predictive modeling/analytics. This is the eventual goal for People Analytics units -- but given the relative recency of the industry, it's a work in progress for many organizations.

I like your idea of a portfolio piece using public data. My I/O program partnered with local organizations for applied projects like this, which you could do some pro-bono consulting to build on. In my case, we administered an engagement survey to a government parks department and used SPSS/Tableau to analyze/visualize these results. Many organizations are just sitting on useful data with the potential for analytics.

Besides the technical skills, being in an I/O program will help your soft skills with explaining and presenting data and concepts. I think one of the most important skills is explaining technical/non-technical data and concepts to a variety of audiences, which is something that you'll do almost every day in this field.

When I first entered grad school, I  thought I was entering a harmonious environment of intellectual peers. I now laugh that I ever expected anything but a cut-throat environment of gossip, sabotage and toxic relationships.

Tenured professors, that aren't going anywhere for decades, along with their egos, personal ambitions, competition of limited resources/placements, and stress/pressure to publish and secure funding, breeds a toxic work environment.

And that hostility trickles down to the students, who in turn often have a goal to become a tenured professor themselves. Which, due to stress, limited placements and funding, often find themselves engaging in psychological warfare against their peers. Further, graduate students don't typically have HR support or leadership above their supervisor they can safely leverage to handle any conflicts or harassment.

It's even likely that any conflicts, harassment or gossip are perpetuated by professors/supervisors that have a 'history' between each other. That is, tenured professors with long standing grudges, that have exhausted all other channels to fight each other, will turn their petty tendencies towards the students. Even if you don't want to engage, you might find yourself involuntarily involved in a fight between people that have all the control over your future.

And even if you can find a neutral space for yourself, you'll probably still have to contend with a toxic relationship with your own supervisor that holds 100% of the power in your working relationship. And you have to survive that for \~2-10 years.

IO psychology is 'Psychology applied to Work' and IO psychologists get jazzed about work as a concept, but most other people don't.  IO psychologists want to make 'work better' for others, and the way we do that (often) is through designing better selection systems to ensure person-environment fit, creating more robust jobs (enlargement, enrichment), training better leaders, ensuring the human experience is considered during organizational changes.

It's worth remembering and reaffirming from time to time  that ""a job will first and foremost be an economic relationship."" (p. 107 in the e-version I've got).  Yep, IO psychologists want people to have a good and meaningful job, but like most psychologists - also want them to have a full and rich life.

I like to read books from time to time like this to see what the macro narrative about work is and how it changes over time, different authors (economists, social workers, journalists, anthropologists, businesspeople) have different ways to frame the way (usually) Americans may think about work, and it's useful to see the structure they follow.",1

AGILE is a project management concept that just means taking an iterative approach. Doing this helps improve communication between stakeholders such as your clients to your team leads allowing for a more flexible approach that often ends with an end product that is more in sync with their wants and needs. A waterfall method, is an alternative to this - which is more often seen in very bureaucratic environments, as each component needs to be handled before the next is started.

Using your expertise as someone who studies jobs, you can use a current job analysis then add your own take (e.g., automation, AI, ChatGPT, economic developments, globalization, supply chain issues, government policy, etc.). You can also still ask a future facing question or two in your panels, but just keep in mind that a current state job analysis is going to look different from a future oriented job analysis.

Item homogeneity will increase reliability because youll have a bunch of highly correlated items measuring the same thing (which will look like high reliability but is really just multicolinearity). Raters being inaccurate (and thus inconsistent with each other) is most likely going to wreck your reliability (unless its a situation in which they are all inaccurate in the same way), and longer tests are more reliable then shorter test (see the spearman-brown prophecy formula). That leaves time allotment. Rushing people can make them less accurate, which can then lead to less reliability than if they had been able to take their time and answer more items correctly (which means more items will be correlated with each other and thus increase your reliability). 

The issue in terms on selecting the correct answer here is that all of these are a matter of degrees. Holding all things to a moderately problematic degree of severity suggests that time allotment will have the least detrimental impact on reliability. However, if the time pressure is severe and the others are less severe then that throws the whole thing off. 

This is a bad item on so many levels. Most notably, this is a context driven issue and this item type cannot provide you with enough context to make a reasonable decision.

One would think that, if any test in the world would have reliable, well-constructed items, it would be the CSP. If your review materials are made up of past exam questions, this one makes me cringe a bit. Psychometrics is not my primary field, and even I can dig back to my grad school days and probably pull out at least one article each on why each of these factors are massively impactful to reliability. Since this is your field of study, I assume you can do that 10 times over.

That said, I would personally select either  A - time allotment, or D - scorer accuracy. Item homogeneity will, of course, increase reliability and indicate internal consistency, and its pretty widely held that longer tests are significantly more reliable. As for scorer accuracy - I mean, obviously, the type of test is going to matter. If, for instance, there is a definite answer key, then scorer accuracy can be more an indicator of other factors such as test difficulty, teaching efficacy, etc. - it just depends so much and HOW the scorers are accurate or inaccurate. however, assuming that your scorers are all over the map, this would really bork the tests reliability. Time allotment is problematic for a lot of reasons (the [gernsbacher, et al., 2020 article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314377/) has a good breakdown on that, I think), but honestly my hunch for why this might be the correct answer is simply the continued widespread use of time allotted tests and exams, still permeating the field.

Super interesting to see an IO psychologist lean in hard to the mass market audience on personality tests and quizzes.  IMO I like the approach of skipping over go-nowhere arguments on validity and reliability and straight to the thing that most people want to know, which is 'can I change my personality?'

the author's view is a definitive 'yes' and the book is full of reflective questions designed to get you thinking about goals.  In his view 'your goals shape your identity.'  By the end of the book it went too far over the line of 'power of positive thinking' for me.

There's a lot of critical insight to be gained from that viewpoint, especially when identity and reputation are very different from each other.

Fleeson's perspectives on traits as density distributions of goal states are also seriously neglected. This is the bridge to what Hardy is talking about in this book in terms of goals being the means of shaping identity -- he's riffing on some theoretical mashup of Fleeson &amp; Hogan.",1_1

I really like this viewpoint because it moves us past fixed labels and static differences. For example, you may be more extraverted than me on average, but our distributions of states overlap substantially.

The issue is job relatedness and the evidence you have to support job relatedness. The issue in Griggs is that the org had very little evidence that intelligence was job related and used intelligence tests across a wide spectrum of jobs. This led the court to rule (in the context of when these tests we instituted in relation to the CRA 1964 being passed) that intelligent tests in this context were a pretext or proxy for racist segregation of the workforce. 

BFOQ is reserved for cases in which you can violate the CRA and other similar legislation because something like sex is bona fide. The job can only be done by someone of that sex. For example, a female gym coach for a female gym class. A school district has the right to argue that a gym coach must be female for a female gym class in case the gym coach must enter the locker room. We can quibble over whether that is necessary or is the class should be mixed gender - but it happens and is defensible. It is very difficult to find an applicable case for BFOQ outside of sex.

It doesn't do well across the world's many wonderful cultures, traditions, preferences, abilities, education and job opportunities.

This is why a good selection process won't rely on a single assessment score to make hiring decisions. However, that is an approach that I see a lot of employers commonly apply. Nobody ever said that any test is meant to boil a person down to a single number, and organizations are forced to make a decision based on simplified scoring; yet this is something that I keep seeing employers doing when they hire, while also criticizing how no tools can reduce a person down well enough.

So for example, if the concern was that the Spacial Awareness score could skew the Verbal Reasoning score when aggregated, the process should have supplemented the cognitive assessment with an SJT or work simulation (and have the opportunity to be thoroughly assessed) to provide a more nuanced profile. 

&gt;The role really matters. Someone with low IQ but high conscientiousness may end up being the world's best trolley collector, and stay in that role very happily for 20 years. Someone with high conscientiousness and average IQ may leave soon to find a better role. 

I see this more as a Retention/Turnover issue that are mostly influenced by on-the-job factors more than a question of assessment quality. Selection assessments aims to predict future on-the-job *performance*, not tenureship. It is possible for someone with high conscientiousness (this is a trait characteristics, btw) and average/high IQ to happily stay in a role for decades if they receive adequate support from leadership, are given enough autonomy on the job, perceive high organizational transparency/justice, are offered ample training opportunities, etc. 

I notice people put a lot of weight on the initial selection assessments, and then when anyone departs for the organization for any reason, they are quick to conclude that it was because the personality/IQ/multiple-choice tests are just not useful.",12_2_1_2

Working as an IO consultant may be a challenge without the being able to demonstrate experience working in complex organizations. Even those with degrees in IO sometimes struggle to find relevant employment.

My spouse is a therapist and this is the largest overlap we see in our fields: same undergrad degree, solid understanding of theories and applications of social psychology, and we are both change managers. I work in organizational change and we view her role of therapist as enabling and helping individuals go through their personal and relational change. Despite us seeing that relevance, it would be unlikely for her to find employment in a corporate setting doing change management just like I wouldnt have the skill sets required to be a therapist/counselor.

Another approach could be to seek entry level opportunities in the field and hope you could move up and around quickly.

I have been doing ""I/O consulting work"" for several years now. I would be a horrible Clinical Psychologist. Clinical Psychology and IO Psychology are not the most compatible fields. While a bachelor's degree in psychology is the foundation of each, the KSAs required to be competent at the other are quite different. I say this, not because I think the switch is impossible, but because I think the switch may not be as straightforward as you appear to think in your post. IO Consulting work comes in all shapes and sizes and you really need to be an EXPERT in one of the sub-fields to experience a fruitful career.

This brings me to the certificate. I do not think the certificate is a great course of action regarding a career change. The certificate will allow you to reacquaint yourself with IO topics you might have learned about in undergrad but it will not provide you with the qualifications or KSAs to be a competent IO practitioner. The certificate is made of four courses all of which are at the introductory level. None of these classes will make you an expert in anything related to IO, and thus most likely will not impact your ability to get a job as an IO consultant. They will also not go into detail enough to provide you with the skills you will need. 

[Code of Ethics](https://www.apa.org/ethics/code) \- I would have concerns around section 2 with or without this certificate. 

**My recommendation** \- 

* Define the topic of IO that interests you the most. I think leadership coaching, as suggested by u/creich1, is definitely the most direct transition for you. For this, you are probably more qualified than many IO practitioners and you would just need some certifications in using assessments like Hogan Assessments.
* If you want to work in selection, assessment, training &amp; evaluation, OD, etc... You would definitely benefit from doing a full masters program.

First of all, your typical ""basic recruiter job"" will most likely be at external staffing agencies. Those places are usually low-quality shops that are not applying any IO- or evidence-based methodologies to conduct recruitment. You will get a front row seat to how the process works, but that process is typically a random trial-and-error tactic based on what you feel might work just to get the job done (i.e., throw bodies into the building). You will be working along side folks who have zero background in IO, HR, OD, or may not even have an advanced degree at all. The techniques that you are forced to use, only serve the purpose of grabbing a talent from the market, cramming them into a role, and fulfilling your contract so you can get a commission and your agency makes money. It is not remotely close to how an IO would conduct recruitment for personnel selection; and if you would be shocked at the differences in approach and application once you get into grad school and learn how to really perform that function. You might have to put in more work to unlearn the bad habits and mindsets  you've picked up in the field.

If it is a recruitment role within an actual HR department, the story might be different. But, HR roles (even at a specialist position to only conduct recruitment) is pretty difficult to get into based on the inflated requirements I've been seeing over the years. If you can get one, then great. Still, I've run into a lot of HR Managers and Generalists who feel that they are very different from an academically-trained practitioner, so their conceptualization of ""Recruitment and Selection"" lean more towards the sales job described earlier, than a strategic approach to validly examine and identify the appropriate applicants suitable for the role.

I'm really confused about the other comments here, who seem to unequivocally advocate for this pathway. There are a lot of real-world nuances that are often overlooked in this topic, and we can't just assume that any ""recruitment"" role will check the box.",5

IO is different from something like clinical or school psych, because we have no certification, no licensure, and no accreditation. That means school reputation is just about the only information employers have to go on as to your IO skills beyond some kind of work sample test (which are quite common).

The better programs (like Mankato!) also have extensive alumni networks and business connections that you can benefit from for a very long time.

Maybe a better way to think about it is that the best schools will open doors for you with unique opportunities you would have a hard time imagining right now, and other schools are unknowns and will in turn make you an unknown.

I have brought business cards before, but I haven't done this in the last 5-6 years or so. Many people now use digital business cards/LinkedIn links, so I haven't seen many business cards at the conference lately.

  
All this being said, bringing your resume and/or business cards won't \*hurt\* you, it may just not help very much, if at all.

The reasons you'd get a certificate in the first place are because the course offers knowledge or skills you don't already have and/or because having the certificate would advance your education or career in some way. For example, you might be interested in a data or programming certificate because you believe it's the best way to learn the material. Alternatively, you might want a certain certificate since it's a requirement for a job or is well known in the industry, such as the PHR and SHRM certifications among HR professionals.

A lot of certificate programs accomplish neither of these things, as many are low quality and/or aren't known to people outside the organization that offers it.

Before enrolling in any certificate program, I'd start with ""How does this certificate advance me as a professional?"" and for IO, I imagine the follow-up questions would be ""What do I want to be doing in IO after I graduate and how would this certificate help me get there?""

Looking at the list you provided, the Data Modeling certificate like it'd be the most useful for a prospective IO student, and personally, I think being able to work with data in professional settings is a generally useful skill to have, even if you don't plan on pursuing a numbers-heavy career. The rest don't seem relevant, except the Conflict Management certificate, but you'll probably take a Conflict Management course in your IO program anyway.

Keep in mind that, as others said, an IO PhD can be more applied, more statistics and assessments focused, and more supportive of working or doing internships during the PhD (this is my experience in the area I live). As well, remember that a PhD can be incredibly long, especially in North America vs the European model, and about 50% of all PhD students never finish their degree because they drop out. That rate may be lower in IO and OB, but it's a risk nonetheless.


Why not try to work in those areas first? Either after undergrad or after a master's that focuses on stats/assessments/research.

The real question is whether you need a PhD to begin with. If you are location restricted getting into any reputable PhD program regardless of field will be extremely challenging.

Strong programs are  very competitive, with very few slots (3-5 per cohort) and restricting yourself to a particular location obviously makes getting a space harder. I would not advise you to do any PhD program where you enroll with a large cohort, do your training online, pay for your program, etc.

All the core stats at the operational level that your typical program covers (stuff up to regression) can be learned through video guides on YouTube.

And stats analysis can be done for free through program language like R and/or Python. It takes personal effort, but it is doable if youre committed. The more basic stuff you can even do in Excel. 

It is true that to get into grad school, you will most likely be disadvantaged without formal coursework. In such a case, you might consider an entrance exam that test for it and blow that portion of the test out of the water. In the US for example, we have a psychology-specific GRE (as well as a general one) that is optional for most programs. However, doing well on it would suggest you know your core psych stuff, including the stats that are commonly used in psych.

If your backup plan would be to start your own business straight out of school, a business bachelor's might be the better idea.

-High student to faculty ratio -- if a faculty member supervises too many students, you will not get individualized attention 
-Do some LinkedIn sleuthing to see where alumni end up. If it's working for the school they went to, it's probably a scam.

//I/O psychology as a field is for sure going through a revolution and transformation at this time.  I've continued to watch it broaden and those non-traditional jobs gain traction, awareness and understanding and legitimacy as 'real I-O' jobs since mid-2010's in the IO field.

I've understood the transition like this.  If you 'needed an I/O psychologist' in 1980's - 1990's - you damn sure needed someone who could design a selection or assessment instrument and certainly do survey research.

That's what academics and their guest lecturers were teaching, and that's what large businesses (where IOs usually worked) needed.

Since mid-2000s the national (US) business landscape has changed, significantly, including the ways that organizations operate, do business, and use technology.  A little thing like the internet can make a big difference, lol.

Businesses still need selection, and still need engagement surveys, they also need a lot more people science applied at work as well - and still aren't sure what psychology can do for them, in the same ways they aren't always sure what economics can do for them.   For traditional organizations, psychology = clinical and it doesn't mean experimental, and that's a mindset that still needs breaking.

For professors, especially those who have been teaching for a while, they likely have the old dominant paradigm of IO jobs in mind (selection and assessment and surveys) so this is still what they have in mind when they teach.  And new professors with less than 2-5 years under their belt, who knows - but they've got both the tightening of the traditional academic job market from falling birth rates to deal with, as well as their own experience of 'I wanted an academic job, and I got an academic job' so they truncate their need to look broadly at labor and organizational trends (a more traditional economic/management activity anyway) and where other jobs that might be a good fit for the skills and knowledge you learn in IO are.  Plus maybe they are still dealing with the 'people analytics' revolution of the last 10 years.

Back to the real jobs thing, which is most material for lots of posters on this sub.  I have read this narrative so many times (and heard it at SIOP) -  'I picked IO psychology as higher education because I saw IO was the highest paid psychology discipline.'  Totally fine. And I can get the appeal of the linear rational.  ""If I get an IO degree I will get a high paying psychology job.""  But IO psychology is not like management or accounting or chemistry as an academic field or degree.  IO psychology is more like economics or anthropology or sociology.

And it seems posters also ride this awareness wave - they learn that there are all these other jobs that exist that you can do with your IO degree, which is cool - because that's awesome - I can actually find a job.  But not all of those roles request ro require ONLY an IO training or background, and then the wave crests and descends because it feels a bit of a letdown to some to realize that you could have gotten say, a UX role, without doing an MS in I/O, and also spend less of your time explaining what I/O is.

Chances are, there is more than one first-line supervisor, and they might all have direct reports who have expressed those same negative work experiences to some extent.

In the past, since the projects ultimately culminates into a senior leadership briefing, I was able to aggregate the results into general categories of ""Areas of Improvement"". Simply state what the concerns are at a high-level, and spin it right into practical recommendations. Another thing we've done is to administer a mix of qualitative and quantitative assessments, and it just so happens that the specific feedback and egregious ratings are blended into a more nuanced profile of the organization. I don't know how well you can apply these to your scenarios, but the main point is that there is power in numbers and you can leverage that to your advantage.

I've found that if they can still identify who might've said it, then it's been a well-known problem for all the people involved for some time. You're not gonna surprise them with the one or two folks that's probably been griping about this already. By that point, it's really up to the leadership to get those possible solutions from you, or they're just going to continue ignoring it anyways. If you fear there might be retaliation, based on the survey results, just gently remind them that's another area of improvement.

\- Establish a regular cadence - Weekly check-ins for tactical stuff, quarterly (or bi-annual) offsites for strategic work is helpful.   

Strategic offsites can be really helpful - (say, 4 hours) for development and improving team clarity and cohesion - whatever is important for your team at that time,  it can be a [feedback activity](https://thefruitfultoolbox.com/patricklencionisteameffectivenessexercise/), retrospective on a recent project, stakeholder mapping activity, SWOT activity, shared assessment discussion (VIA character strengths is nice), Sharing key skills ([what I need from you](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/24-what-i-need-from-you-winfy/)).

It delves into how recent forces and trends are shaping the workforce along with distilling what science (and the author) thinks that means moving forward post COVID, with the globalization of talent, etc etc. Im not associated with the author or have any stakes in his work& so I am just honestly saying it is a great read. 

For my perspective and input, I really appreciate how the author breaks down how with changing demographics (e.g, more older people retiring and fewer young, new workers relatively speaking entering the workforce) will mean that workers will continue to gain traction with advocating for their rights compared to in the past when companies had more, if not almost all power in that area. To be clear, what the author argues for is less of some sort of generational differences changes and more of a fact that workers are in more demand for fewer of them (aka lower supply than demand) and thus have more bargaining power.

What this really highlighted to me is that right now certain CEOs and companies notice smaller shifts swinging power slightly back in their favor from the height of the reshuffle and are pushing to take advantage of that by reasserting power through actions such as in-office mandates, clawing back benefits, etc. HOWEVER, I completely believe in the long run, these types of short-term power games will lead to those companies significantly losing in both the talent and engagement realms and ultimately losing competitiveness.

Not in analytics (yet) but don't waste your time learning everything you could - e.g. sql, r, and python - specifically target the tools in use at your location. This only applies since you're already employed and trying to transfer.

Since you're asking on an IO forum, and not an HR one (jab at our hr buddies), I assume you want an IO answer, and to that I say...
IT DEPENDS.

You heard me, I said it. It depends on the specific roles and what you want to incentivize at the company. If you want to approach this issue as an IO, make a custom PA system for the role. 

But generally sounds like your manager is very open to you learning regardless, you're not gonna shake things up as a trainee. It's far better you just tell your manager your interested, demonstrate your ability to interpret data and learn how they do things. If you want to make tweaks later then recommend them once you know how and why they do what's in place already.",1

You'll want to learn those tools if you want a future career in analytics in general, but in order to figure out how to get started in analytics at your specific company, youll be better served at figuring out what exactly your company uses. 

So TLDR: First, find out what tools are used at your company, and focus on learning those tools first. When I say tools, I mean any platform used to store, retrieve, and analyze data.

That isn't meant to discourage you from trying different ideas, but more to say that you can still have a successful and effective student organization despite membership volume.

If these are high school or college students, there might also be a component of activism-academic interests at play that is driving the retention/turnover mechanism; some kids just lose interest in what the organization is trying to accomplish, or students have a hard time seeing how their membership could help with distinguishing themselves from other applicants if they go on to pursue college/grad school/internship opportunities, etc. (So perhaps addressing this gap could bolster retention - more on this later.) It comes down to the mission of the student organization, and whether it's worth to potentially sacrifice organizational goals to ""keep numbers high"". It's a balancing act that is for the individual organization's executive to wrestle based on current needs. 

I had been involved with a local professional association as one of their executive leaders for several years. There are pros and cons to both sides of the coin. We sometimes didn't have enough people to carry out an org activity, but the few people who are involved are very passionate and eager to get things done. We've had an influx of members to finally do the things that the association wants to accomplish, but have run into the ""too many cooks"" and ""design by committee"" situations that really mired the effort's forward momentum. 

Like you said, getting member feedback could help. I've designed membership engagement surveys and post-event feedback forms to collect insight from new incoming members and event attendees on how the organization provided incremental value to their personal needs/goals. Our membership drives are cyclical, so we especially engage conversations with current and prospective members towards the end of the year through the beginning of the next. (Our executive team were required to serve one year, so we'd have a new President annually.) In addition, some of the factors that made me stay as a member and executive were:

* Seeing the camaraderie between former members and executives with the current group. It's not just ""I did my time and I'm done here"", we're invited back to attend future events, take on advisor roles, and kept certain organizational practices evergreen for future executive teams and association members.

* Holding a sort of ""state of the organization"" orientation to clearly state what the President wants to accomplish during their time, and how current members can actively contribute in achieving those accomplishments.  

* Always keeping our members in mind. We were allowed to generate activities and events based on our personal capabilities, but always tied it back to how it will bring value to the members and the community.",2

If its a full day meeting with the leadership team youll be reporting to or working with, then I think it makes more sense to send a handwritten thank you note. Again, as long as its authentic. 

Likely, however, the opportunities youre seeking somewhere in between these two extremes. So, then Id say do whatever feels right to you. 

Me personally? I send personal thank you notes after the meetings I have with organizations or hiring managers that I could actually see myself working with.

If your users are starting the survey, but not finishing it, chances are its just too long and/or complicated. (There could also be issues where users fear for their anonymity being compromised by demographics questions). Boils down to what are you trying to accomplish with this survey? Where can you cut back?

If theyre tired of surveys altogether, chances are its because your organization isnt actually doing anything with the feedback being provided. The answer is to actually communicate the results from the survey, you said X, we hear you, and we plan to do Y. But even thats not enough, it requires being proactive in communicating what changes are being made, even if it feels obvious. People need to be told We did X because you said Y, and we are continuing to do Z if you want the impact to truly be felt. Survey cadence is also important, but, in my opinion, it ties back to what Ive just said. If you do a survey in January and then again in February, did anyone actually have a chance to communicate and digest the results? Did leadership actually have the time to make any changes based on the results? To communicate those changes? Or for individuals to actually feel the impact of those changes?

This is something weve made it a point to stress to our leaders in my org. We tell them to over communicate whats happening and why, and weve seen improvements in engagement including an increase in (largely positive) acknowledgements about the changes being made to address the issues raised.",1

Different employers - both academic and in practice - have different expectations about ""presence."" 

There are academic departments that fully expect their faculties to be present, for example, 8-4 M-F. There are others who don't care at all where you are as long as you get expected work done. This is worse in some ways, since you may have more to do than can reasonably fit in a 40-hour workweek. There are other academic employers who don't care \_at all\_ - and there are certainly some ""career associate professors"" who take advantage of this by achieving tenure and then drop their weekly effort down into single-digit hours - basically attending their own classes and doing nothing else. Not as many of this sort of person around these days, but they're very noticeable when they are, since they create extra work for everyone else.

Aside from the tenure issue, the same pattern is generally true of practice roles - you can find jobs where you are expected to have ""face time"" on-site with 40 hours and then another 20 hours of work to do when you get home. Others will not bother you while you WFH as long as you get your weekly tasks done, which you might get done much faster than 40 hours.

In both cases, your work-life balance is largely driven by organizational policy and local culture/norms. So be sure to figure out what those are before you accept any job offer. :)",2

**Opening your own consulting business:** It's not impossible for people to do this right out of the program, but I feel like not many are comfortable talking about the realistic prospects and likelihood of success.

Many of us wanted to start our own consulting firms before we left. It's a really sexy career goal and something you shouldn't let go if you're really serious about it. However, opening your shop requires more than a solid grasp of IO Psych topics. There's billing and invoicing, contract acquisition and negotiation, marketing and promotion, industry politics, and so many aspects to a operating a consulting firm that no program seem to cover (especially at a Master's level). 

Again, not impossible. I've seen a handful of cases where new grads/young pros start an LLC or something, but they all folded eventually, if not limped on for years. It's practically a second career. Which is why most of us just settled on attaching ourselves to an established firm instead and not worry about all that overhead.

**Number 4:** Go to office hours. Nearly every one of them if you can.

Get good with the faculty by attending the hours that they've specifically set aside to meet you. You can come in and ask clarification on things you didn't understand in the lecture/reading, or just chat casually about the recent research studies they're working on (trust me, they're more than happy to do a deep dive). You put in that face time and get familiar with them, they might casually drop a nugget of valuable outside-the-class information or opportunity that will help with your career long-term.",2

* There are plenty of materials out there that are free if you cannot afford to pay for prep courses.
* Keep in mind that you can take the test multiple times, so if you do not do as well as you think you can, you can take it again.
* If test anxiety is a significant problem and is holding you back, seek resources/treatment for that. My university gives it to students for free. If is is an issue for the GRE, it might be an issue in grad school.
* Do not over-think. I have had many students tell me they flunked an exam only to find they nailed it. Take a more positive view and do not assume that you are unable to score well.

People Analytics is the most obvious fit, but a lot of companies don't explicitly list the role as such. They'll use terms like ""HR Data Analyst"", ""Organizational Transformation Analyst"", ""People Operations Analyst"", ""People Data Scientist"", etc. But there will be some that explicitly reference ""People Analytics"", which mine did. So it's a little harder to search for than a lot of other traditional I/O or HR roles, you'll have to get creative and sort through a ton of results that aren't what you're looking for. Make sure you read the job duties and qualifications thoroughly to avoid wasting your time. Many emoyers will also improperly title a position imo.

And this is really the crux of the issue for me, which creates a lot of paradoxes and begs a lot of questions as we're trying to establish a recognizable brand. 

Are we not calling ourselves ""psychologists"" because we're afraid of being misunderstood in what we do? But then why do we keep insisting to present our field as a branch of Psychology? Why are we also letting public (mis)perception dictating our introduction, if this field continuously want to change public perceptions about what it is we do?",3_1

Whoever I'm introducing it to can learn about it too. There are many jobs that exist now (I know IO existed) that didn't exist 20 years ago and there will be new ones in the next 20. Those people will have to figure out how to explain what they do to others. IOs aren't the only ones that have to explain what they do.

My thing is that I don't get the hang-ups we have about calling ourselves ""psychologist"" when it solves a lot of the problems that we keep raising about IO, over technicalities that doesn't matter to the laymen.

HR, teachers, and nurses also have specializations and scopes of responsibilities; but we don't hear them trip over technicalities like we do. ""Well, technically I'm just a Reading Specialist for K-5, but you can't call me a Teacher because I don't literally have my own class full-time..."" That clarification might arise after the listeners' interest is piqued and they want to know more details, but those practitioners simply start off with Teacher or Educator. Because at the end of the day, that's what that person does, and the language inherently matches what the audience's expectations and visions are when that person clocks in for work.

We seem to hold ourselves back from the get-go. Meanwhile, there are so many Life Coaches and Motivational Speakers who have zero qualms about stealing (and misusing) psychological terminologies and concepts to establish their credentials.

Not all researched areas of psychology have a practice basis. Evolutionary and environmental psychology are two examples of such. However, Org Psych is most definitely a research and practice-based area of psychology, and does involve diagnosis/prognosis at scale (in most cases).   


Examples of diagnosis:

* Org culture change is essentially a mass-scaled behavioural intervention; it first requires diagnosis. Think of the immense potential repercussions if done incorrectly or unethically. 
* Personnel selection is (depending on how you view it) a prognosis for sought-after work-related behaviours. Or it can be a diagnosis of risk, in the case of non-sought-after workplace behaviours. Again, imagine if done unethically or disregarding evidence. 
* Leadership coaching requires diagnosis. There's a problem to solve. With, potentially, impactful repercussions for everyone subordinate to that leader. Ethics and evidence basis here are similarly required.

The real reason for the ""psychologist"" title is registration standards. Unlike other business practitioners, psychologists have an ethical obligation to understand evidence-based practice and the ramifications of their activities before engaging in them. They are required to have the moral and ethical rights of their clients in mind, including the potential repercussions of their actions on those clients. That's the actual distinction, and the real reason why the title of ""psychologist"" as a regulated title is worthwhile, it conveys a particular training and ethical obligation that we've passed by assessment of our peers and accredited bodies in the field. 

The fact that society doesn't know much about other areas of practice in psychology (e.g., neuropsych, community, health, sports, etc..) is an issue for professional bodies to address. I realise it's very complicated in America due to individual state registration requirements. However, I envision a future in which a wide variety of psychologists are recognised and can register, to signify their impact on and obligations towards society.",3_1_3

In the states, if a person has any kind of background in any kind of psychology, they must follow the ethical practices of the American Psych Association whether or not they call themselves a psychologist.

How do they enforce it?

And I think the crux of the issue is the poor conceptualisation of ""mental health"" in the general population :

* The general population thinks of mental health as spanning a range from -10 to 0. 
* In reality the spectrum is more like -10 to +10. i.e., from dire to flourishing. 
* And we as org psychs tend to focus on getting people into the positive flourishing end of the spectrum, as well as preventing people from slipping downward. Or forseeing potential issues from policies that could lead to negative consequences. 

Maybe I'm projecting here, but I think Org Psychs tend to undervalue just how similar they are to ""real"" psychologists. We just operate on different scales, and different ends of the spectrum.

There's not good evidence that most popular modern IQ tests are culturally/racially biased, and in fact the questions and overall tests are rigourously screened for this very problem. There are group differences, because of course there are. Different racial groups do not grow up in environments equally healthy for cognitive development, on average. If the tests are valid, there should be differences. Bias on these tests is really only a problem when used inappropriately (eg using a vocab test with ESL kids).

Gardner's theory is pop-psych nonsense that has found its way into intro psych textbooks, but no serious differential psychologist would treat it as a serious model of intelligence. If anything, it's more of a taxonomy of abilities, and even then it's poor and not based on empirical evidence. It's true that there are multiple theories/definitions of intelligence, but most modern/supported theories will include something like g, an overall intelligence construct.

As far as interviewing goes, if all of the employees are in the same department could you break up the interview questions into smaller chunks, randomize the questions, then send them to the employees to answer? For example if you intend to ask, say, 10 questions, maybe ask 5 questions and send them to half the employees, and the other 5 questions to the other half.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Philosophy**:

We have a very simple very philosophy that we tell everyone:

Better Well-being ---&gt; Better Engagement ---&gt; Better retention / productivity

and the inverse is also true 

Lower Well-being ---&gt; Lower Engagement ---&gt; Lower retention / productivity

So it makes sense that whenever we want to start to have any kind of measurements that we start by well-being

&amp;#x200B;

**How we define well-being:**

One of the challenges of employee well-being is that it sounds very holistic and hence can be difficult to tackle using concrete metrics, but to make it easier we breakdown well-being into multiple sub-types:

1. Career Well-being
2. Social Well-being
3. Financial Well-being 
4. Physical Well-being

For each each type of well-being we assign 2 or 3 metrics that help us monitor those well-being. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its important to note that there is no universal standard for types of well-being and people can add and take away from the list above. However, for companies that are only getting started with monitoring well-being , the list above are more than enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Metrics to measure well-being:**

Metrics for Career Wellbeing:

1) Autonomy

2) Mastery

3) Sense of Purpose

&amp;#x200B;

Metrics for Social Well-being:

1) Team Harmony

2) Work-life Balance 

&amp;#x200B;

Metrics for Financial Well-being:  


1) Financial Security 

2) Financial Freedom 

&amp;#x200B;

Metrics for Physical Well-being

1) Nutrition

2) Sleep 

&amp;#x200B;

**Employee Engagement:**

We measure engagement like you suggested using eNPS model. But we tend to focus on those employees who scored lower than 6. We look at their well-being metrics to see what is root cause behind their rating. 

&amp;#x200B;

**On Employee burnout:**

It is such grey area from both ethical and measurement point of view. I originally wanted to include it as part of the metrics but I eventually gave up 

Sometimes however, I focus on Career Well-being as it is the best ""proxy"" for burnout. Employees with lower sense of purpose and autonomy are much more likely to feel a burnout. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps, if you are interested in the survey questions we do, drop me a DM and I can shoot it over! :)",7

The VPA does look pretty narrow and is specific to assessing volunteers and volunteer engagement.

Having several of you do it from one program can create the appearance that it's affiliated with the university, even if it's not. Also, we are generally not ok with students taking on work that is not under the guidance of faculty or a formal role somewhere else (i.e., working under someone who knows what they're doing, and that doesn't include other students).

I won't go so far as outright tell you not to do it. Unless you're my student, because then when you approach me I will tell you not to do it. But either way, I *really* don't think you should do it without anyone knowing, because it could look like you're trying to hide it.

Just being honest with you.

EDIT: To be clear, I am not anti-applied work for students. I support my students in getting internships, etc. I just don't want them doing work they're not very good at with no oversight.",3

Search for 'Business model canvas"" and use it to spark some discussion amongst your core team for how you might consider your endeavor. - Get everyone together physically or virtually and do this.  Have people come prepared with thoughts.   

It's great that you already have your first client, as this is often a challenge for many groups.  Get testimonials at the end of your time with the client.

If you decide you want to pursue this path as a real corporation then you'll need to sort out: marketing, branding, establishing yourself as a business etc.  There are usually many resources available for starting small businesses on your state's government website.

Look for HR analyst or talent acquisition roles as those generally have the lowest barriers to entry.

2) Yes, program matters quite a lot because many programs are very low quality. Many universities have spun up I/O Master's programs as money-makers without investing in actually developing a strong academic program. You're in Philly, so your best local option is West Chester IMO, although others may have different thoughts. If you want to pivot toward HR rather than I/O, then look at Villanova's HR Development program. It's costly, but good. 

3 &amp; 4) You can go online, but many online programs are poor choices. They are frequently taught by weak faculty and usually to academically under-prepared students without much work experience. They don't offer the curriculum and hands-on opportunities that you need to get off to a successful start. George Mason and Colorado State are on my very short list of online programs that are worth a damn, but I'd still prioritize a quality in-person option so that you can benefit from regional internships and networking.

2. Institution does not matter directly. It does however put your GPA into context. More rigorous coursework (such as taking graduate level courses) and more relevant majors (psych, business) are viewed more favorably. Importantly, for most programs, you MUST have taken at a minimum Intro psych, stats, and methods. Otherwise you might need to take remedial courses before you can start a PhD program, assuming you are accepted.

3. Varies a lot. Almost all of our international PhD students end up with US jobs if they want US jobs. However you do need to navigate the visa system, which is not the most pleasant. Major universities will have much better infrastructure to help international students navigate these sorts of issues. Some jobs allow for more favorable visa options than others (e.g., the academic faculty path).

4. Not sure what you mean here - what are you exiting?

5. Like almost every knowledge economy field on earth right now, more statistics, data science, and AI expertise will go a long way.

2. An additional business degree would probably help. Although, I majored in psych and business with a minor in cs and my minor in cs increased my chances more than my business major.

3. Dont have insight into this. There are plenty of international students in IO PhD programs. 

4. Not sure what youre asking

5. Stats skills were the most important thing I learned in undergrad to prep me for PhD programs. IO is quant heavy. Learn regression and if youre involved in research (which you have to be if you want to get into a PhD program) find opportunities to apply stats skills in a research setting.

6. Idk if the specialization matters too much. Since youre a freshman I think you can just choose whichever specialization sounds interesting to you in case you want to make a career path switch later.

I decided I wanted to pursue IO in my freshman year as well and got into good PhD programs straight out of undergrad. If you want to pursue this path, get involved with research as soon as possible. Find high quality research experiences where youll be doing more than just data collection (that experience is good too, though). Your research experience also doesnt have to be in IO. Since youre starting so early, you could potentially get a couple publications before you apply which would greatly improve your chances. It did for me.",2

1) Yes it is viable. I recommend jumping straight from an undergrad to a PhD since public universities can fully pay for your tuition, provide you with an additional stipend income, and because you can decide to just stop at your master's and not go for the PhD if you want. Whereas a terminal master you typically have to pay out of pocket, and sometimes the credits you earn in don't even count towards your PhD. So not only does it save you immense financial resources, but also time resources as well. Getting a PhD just allows you more opportunities overall. Most people who go into a PhD program do so for the purpose of academic &amp; research interests. However, having a PhD and going down the applied side serves to further enhance your credibility &amp; is correlated to a higher income (I highly highly recommend you to use the SIOP website. They essentially have all the relevant information for any new prospective I/O members). 

2) If I had to guess, I wouldn't say it should matter too much. The main thing that I've heard is really just having the research experience necessary, since the main route of a PhD is for research &amp; academic related purposes.

3) Unsure about international students, but regardless, what I've heard from every long-tern I/O faculty is that networking is just as crucial as the degree. The field is still small, so it's extremely vital to network &amp; connect with others. Nearly half of all job vacancies are filled via networking, and I suspect it's more true when it comes to this field (I've heard many other users talk about how important networking is in this field). So basically, if you want to increase your chance of getting a job after graduating, the #1 thing you need to focus on during graduate studies is networking, building connections, &amp; taking advantage of internship opportunities.

4) Unsure. 

5) If you're interested in HR, obtaining a SHRM certificate will be a huge boost to your employability &amp; credentials. Asides from that, I don't know much else (still a 1st year graduate student, so I'm actively learning this as well) 

6) Unsure.

IME, declined promotions are best explained in terms of simple equity theory: the candidate feels that the higher job's ratio of outputs (pay, status, etc.) to inputs (effort, expectations, etc.) is worse than the ratio that they currently have. Lots of leaders just look at the difference in outputs and can't understand why people aren't interested in promotion while ignoring the vast, non-linear increases in expected inputs that occur at certain title jumps (e.g., manager to director). Making less money for reasonable contributions can be a hell of a lot more attractive than making more money for far greater contributions. 

Individual differences probably matter here too. People who are low on McClelland's needs for power and achievement are probably less drawn to promotions, as are people lower on Super's work values concerning status, influence, leadership, and independence. Work conditions would also interact with individual differences to shape this decision; for example, a promotion to a risky or challenging role may be less attractive to a prevention-focused person than promotion to a safer or more secure role.",1

I see that as connected to the equity theory angle, particularly if we think about mental health (or wellbeing in a broader sense) as an input. I think this is the endgame thinking for a lot of the work/family literature; sacrificing parts of your personal life is, in a very real sense, what jobs expect us to contribute to the exchange relationship.

The other issue on the output side is that the outputs buy us far less than they once did. When that ""big raise"" still leaves you laughably far away from being able to own a home or start a family, then what's really the point of chasing it? I'm even seeing this in academia with folks who see little point in going from Assoc to Full Professor because the necessary hustle to put together a strong promotion portfolio isn't worth the modest increase in salary.

just ask the employees what's up, and present suggestions for the owner to act on (aka what a non IO would do).

I want you to take it and get the experience, I'd be pissed if you didn't. But also you don't have the right KSAOs to really do a lot without unecessary risks being involved.

I think you should take it, but partner with someone who knows what they're doing... An advising firm perhaps? If you can't get him onboard with this, then research into premade org assessments he can buy. A tailored one would be best but, again without an understanding of how to do this can lead to issues. I wouldn't jump straight to personality assessments. I know for example, the manufacturing industry has some commercial engagement assessments they can buy that have some validity behind them. Talk him into purchasing something like that, it'll even do the stats for you then all you have to do is interpret the data - which should be easier and less concerning.

I read all the comments in the thread and agree with all their concerns, but I don't think that should hold you back from this opportunity. This sounds like a golden ticket that will let you explore topics that are of interest to you. So to set expectations upfront, you don't have the training or skillset to do anything super meaningful for the company.

A trained, professional IO psychologist would come into this situation and conduct a **needs assessment** to determine what would need to be done to most effectively address the organization's issues/goals. That typically involves surveying and interviewing key stakeholders (employees, management, executives, etc.). In this case, it sounds like the issue is turnover, so you'd want to find out why people are leaving - compensation &amp; benefits, lack of career advancement opportunities, and feeling undervalued/disrespected are common reasons, but you'd have to dig into what's the cause for this company. (**NOTE**: *Because you don't have training, I highly recommend against you doing a needs assessment for your internship, I'm just highlighting what would be done.*)

Based on those findings, you'd provide your client a list of suggestions to address the problem, whether it's improving comp &amp; benefits packages, investing in org design initiatives (e.g., more frequent promotions or lateral internal mobility), implementing a training program, making policy changes to improve the organizational culture, etc.

Based on your post, I would agree with your family friend's idea of using this internship to explore one (or a few) topics within IO psychology that interest you, look into them, and share your findings with them. This will expose you to topics that are interesting without the responsibility/accountability of implementing real changes that could result in negative consequences for the business. I don't want to push you in a particular direction, but if you're looking for ideas, it sounds like **structured interviewing** could be a good place to start. [SIOP](https://www.siop.org/Business-Resources/Employment-Testing/Effective-Interviews) and the [OPM](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/assessment-and-selection/structured-interviews/) have pretty good resources. 

Internships should be about learning while also getting hands-on experience *doing* something, so I think you should do more than research and presenting your findings via a slide deck  (though that would be useful to do as well). It might make sense to split your time by also helping out on some of their HR work. I'd talk to your family friend and try to come up with a plan that gives you time to research &amp; present IO topics to give them ideas of what they could/should do while also doing some administrative/HR work. Maybe they have data entry or analysis you can do in Excel or Sheets, or maybe you can manage some job postings or look to improve one of their processes (e.g., onboarding).

I'd check out [the sub's wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/wiki/index#wiki_io_psychology_wiki) and [the Wikipedia entry] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology) for ideas if you need.

It was a 20 min presentation and I literally had two sentences to say and they were super easy. Guess what happened! I panicked for some reason and got flustered and just messed it up so bad. No time to sit back though as the week after I had my thesis presentation. I wrote down what I wanted to say and memorised everything for a 10 min presentation. It went well and I adopted that method. 

Fast forward a few years later in my job (2020) manager asks me to present to a group of 15-20ppl. I applied the same logic and prepared like mad and delivered two sessions. In 2021, he sent me on a 6 city tour presenting to groups ranging from 15-50 people. Now I deliver 2 hour workshops and get really good feedback.

In that time I realised that me memorising lines was a safety net. I knew what I had to say as I have the knowledge and skill. Most important I respect the fact that people are willing to take hours of their work day to listen to me as a subject matter expert. Therefore I shift the mentality to one simple logic - this is a chance for me to showcase excellence in my field and I will guide the audience through a unique learning experience. I use a lot of storytelling! I get their attention and control the room with my body language and tone. I make it a point to at least say hello at the start to a few role. My number one safety net is to ensure that the start is smooth! So I have memorised an intro for years that I use. With a good start you get in the groove. Sometime I present the second section of a workshop but no issues as my colleague will let me introduce myself at the start and I set expectations based on what I say then. 

Above all - I love doing this! I suppose it shows as I have had few who tell me to be a motivational speaker and I keep getting asked to do more of these presentations. Remarkably Im a lot younger (I have less than 7 years work experience) and present to CEOs, HR professionals, senior govt personnel etc. I think back to that time when I messed up in that group presentation and wanted the earth to open up and eat me. Thankfully I was able to put this behind. I didnt want to let this one failure define my career and over time with good intentions- think its a strong professional skill of mine!",2

And go in to explain that people assume its a HR issue because people dont know how to deal with conflict etc. so tell a story using your experience that summarises this viewpoint.

To me, being a subject matter expert entails that you need to be able to explain the concept to a 5 year old all the way up to a Doctorate qualified practitioner. So look at the way some great public speakers narrate stories like their own. I love Dave Chapelle for that very reason.

I often think of facilitation and facilitating as being something like a character or a role that I play.  In my facilitation role I often have certain well-rehearsed lines I do over and over.  I keep an eye out for where I am in the 'script' of the meeting so I can jump in naturally and authentically with some of these lines when the moment happens. 

Also - a lot of facilitating is asking questions, making observations, and summarizing what's happening.  Here's some of what those lines sound like:

The context setting moment (which might happen multiple times throughout a workshop):  ""Today we are here to..."" ""I would like every to..."" ""What you can expect from this is..."" ""Here's what comes next...""

The ""what just happened"" moment where someone has just put forward a controversial idea or statement or the oppositive, where the statement is too vanilla: ""What makes you think that?"" ""Can anyone think of an example where that might not be the case?"" ""Do others in the room agree with that statement?"" ""What's your \[NAME\] experience with that?""

The ""it's too quiet"" moment: ""I notice we haven't heard from..."" ""do we need a break?""

The ""it's getting too noisy"" moment: ""There's a lot of energy around this idea..."" ""So what I hear you saying is...""",6

This may help you feel more relaxed. As an anecdote, I remember one time I went to do a training and as I was getting all the things prepped in the room, people were saying last training they had to make a conga line and that what could I do to top that off (these were all high execs). Not that you need to do a conga line, but it's just so you get an impression that adults do like humor and this will help alleviate tension/break the ice.

They might also be holding questions for some time that they've been meaning to ask someone and you're there to talk about them, so both you and the audience should connect as a learning experience (this is actually part of my spiel when I start my trainings). If you can't answer a question, it's fine, you're human and not almighty, tell them you have never met this, that it's interesting and you can get back to them later. You can also probe a little more and understand things to improve next time you see the issue. Lastly, you might be surprised that some other member from the audience knows the answer and then they assist on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In that sense, they're the ones who put the value in the training, and you are conductive to this value; other than that it's just a static Power Point in a projector they could had read at home (this is also one of my spiels at the start). Be open to them talking, and from that you can even learn if you're talking about something they already know about and might be not getting much value from it (and determine if you need to give more space to Q&amp;As instead). You're the one holding the mic because someone said it should be like that, but they might be SMEs as well and that's when things get interesting, always keep this in your head.

&amp;#x200B;

As a final thought, they can read when someone is just starting on this whole training stuff or the subject matter anyways, you can't hide that with a script or essaying it a billion times infinity, so go with the idea that you're going to give them a fun and learning morning/afternoon. Some things stick with them, others don't and that's fine, you continue learning and improving and no one is born an expert. Feel confident with the thought that everyone in that room is a human in a learning environment, including you.",9

Youre looking at it as commitment to the university, but what they are seeing (correctly) is someone who wants a place holder until they can leave for a preferred job. It seems like youre thinking of this like getting into a tenure track faculty position is moving up the ladder, a promotion of sorts. And in a personal sense, sure. In a practical sense though, for the folks who run admin for your institution, faculty might as well be a job at another place entirely. The natural progression from admin assistant is another administrative job, not a teaching one. If you accepted a position as a faculty member, yes youd be committed to the university (for a while - the only jobs that move around more than academicians are military, in my experience) the admin office would still be losing an employee and still need to train a new person, and would be losing you as an institutional knowledge resource in a way they would not if you were to be promoted to a managerial position. Its not as if you could reasonably be expected to train a new admin or pitch in to cover paperwork processing if you were busy being a professor. Added to that, depending on the way your university does tenure, you might be moving on after a couple years as an adjunct or an assistant professor anyway as youd presumably be seeking tenure. And on top of all of that, while 3-4 years is a reasonable time to expect to stay in one position before seeking advancement, whether by promotion or finding a new organization, if you had two, equally great candidates in front of you, vying to fill a VERY competitive position, which one would you choose? The one who wants to make their career by advancing in the current position youre offering, or the one who will be looking to leave in 4 years for an entirely different field?",2

The thing is (again, this based on my own experiences with academia, so ymmv) academia is a SLOOOOOWWWW moving beast, and in some areas, woefully behind in the way they think about pay scales and longevity. If another opportunity comes up, my suggestion would be that you dont necessarily need to pretend like administrative assistant is THE job you want to retire from, but rather choose something one or two steps up the ladder from the position youre applying to cite as a medium term goal. For instance, if youre applying as an admin assistant, a step or two up might be, depending on the particular nature and department of the position, Compliance or Accreditation Specialist, Academic Advisor, Alumni Relations, etc. This shows both ambition  and an understanding of the natural progression of the position and the nature of the work.

With that being said, faculty positions in higher Ed are EXTREMELY competitive. For every one faculty role, there are hundreds or even thousands of applicants (depending on the subject matter - heck, it will be tens of thousands if were talking something like language arts) - even at a relatively small institution. EVERYONE wants a faculty role, and people typically will spend years trying to land one before they are successful (if they even are at all) - but the school needs many, many other roles filled to be operational. Due to this, the school doesnt want to put people in an administrative role when the person has made it clear that their intent is to use that role solely to get their foot in the door to try to have a better chance at landing a faculty-gig. What you see as showing them you want to stay with the institution long-term, they see as just another person who is desperate for this super competitive other position &amp; is trying anything they can to get into a school in general. They also assume that if a faculty role is your ultimate goal, that even if you accept this position, you will continue applying for other roles (even at other institutions) for any type of teaching position in which you might qualify - then if you do land one, they will be stuck working to fill this role and train another new person yet again. Similarly, they worry that you will not at all be happy in that position (an administrative role and a faculty role are VERY, very different). Honestly, this is probably the most common reason I had seen candidates turned down by the hiring manager after an interview during my few years there. A good 75% of candidates tell the hiring manager that their long term goals are to become a faculty member. Then a good 98% of hiring managers are instantly turned off by the comment and go with another candidate - one who they feel will be fully engaged in and happy with the role that they are hiring for. Higher Ed is a super unique and interesting industry (and one that is very slow to change/adapt as well - which is why I left, as there was zero opportunity to utilize my IO Psych skills there for that reason), and tactics that might work well or be seen in a positive light in private industry are rarely the same as what will work in that world. 

As much as I hate to admit it, everyone knows that working as an admin assistant there probably isnt your life dream - its not what you grew up telling every adult in your life that its what you wanted to be when you grow up. But if you really want in higher ed in general - you have to play it up. You have to pretend that you live for administrative support functions! When youre bored, you pull up videos of random organized meetings on You Tube just to take meeting notes! You dream about proof reading emails. Youre never as happy as you are when a phone rings and you get to answer it! Its fake, of course. And everyone knows its fake. And the IO psych side of me despises it - but, I cant imagine it will change in that industry anytime in the next few decades to be honest.",4

Something of a tangent, but I'm not sure this is as true as you think it is, and it's definitely not as true as it used to be. Our candidate pools in recent searches have diminished pretty dramatically. The last (non-IO) tenure-track faculty search we ran had a total candidate pool in the single digits, and some of those were totally unqualified because our university insists on posting to Indeed and gets people who shotgun-apply (or use bots, I suppose) to anything that comes up.

Full-time, tenure track faculty roles are really pretty rare to come by (adjunct professorship is much more common however, and not nearly as difficult to land - which I admit, I likely wasnt clear in specifying, as usually [not always] full-time professorship is the ultimate goal) but nonetheless, schools pump out high level degrees in things like English and History, where the career fields are very, very limited outside of education, and the vast majority of candidates seek professorship since it would be rare to find any other relevant opportunities in their field of study, leading to that market being highly over saturated.",4_1_1

Depends on the grad school you want to attend and other factors as well. If you're dead-set on graduate school right after undergrad, the worry should be getting in sufficient research experiences and prepping for the GRE (when the time for that comes). 

Graduate school will care more about your research experiences, but work experience (in *any* domain, not just areas relevant to I/O) will be valuable for building up some income/savings, getting ""real world"" experience, and figuring out what you want from life before dedicating more of your time to school.",2

What makes IO grads valuable is the training in scientific methods, especially statistics and data science, for understanding people at work. So when graduates from a program with an IO degree but without the depth of skills that traditional IO programs have taught, they find themselves unable to find work. I think of these degrees as IO in name only. Most obviously, they do poorly in interviews and dont have a meaningful analytic portfolio. These gaps are very obvious in interviews with IOs who do have that background and can be obvious even to HR hiring managers.

There are also market forces at play right now that make HR relatively risky, specifically the near record low unemployment rate. When orgs are overwhelmed with job applicants, HR and IO both bring much more obvious value through selection and training practices. 

There is also currently a flood of people who want jobs in non-stats/analytics-centric areas of IO, like OD. Generally speaking, the more common your skills are, the more competition youll have, and thus the harder it will be to compete for jobs. There are simply more people exactly like you looking for the same jobs, and thats not a good position to start from.

Beyond that, a lot of people shoot themselves in the foot by tying themselves to a particular geographic area that is not already an IO center. If you dont live or are unwilling to move to DC, New York, Boston, Atlanta, or Minneapolis, you have cut yourself off from probably 80% of IO jobs. It can still work out but hurts your chances.

These issues in combination are the worst. When someone graduates from an online for-profit program  having never actually participated in a real org research project AND has few meaningful stats/data science skills beyond running a t-test AND wants to work remotely, there is just not a lot of work available for that person. Everyone wants to work remotely, so jobs with full remote flexibility favor the most qualified applicants, who are the people who either attended high profile known programs or already have been working in IO for a few years or have built up an impressive portfolio.

Do not assume any random IO degree is an automatic gateway into a particular career path. It just does not work that way. The field is simply too small to support that approach.

Oh - and assuming you can avoid all the pitfalls listed here, skys the limit. Age doesnt matter one bit.",1

Sometimes it's not the I/O skills that lack for folks, it's the professional and business skills.  And sometimes it's the lack of brand recognition for ""I/O"" that contributes to difficulty with finding a job. diminishing the potential to see that those exist, when an MBA has easy brand recognition.

Your transition into I/O (if you want that) will be what you make of it and how you pursue it. Consulting is a good transition for anyone mid-late career, as is coaching.   These are areas that IOs can do, and with training in subject matter, you can bring back to the science behind your recommendation.   Those are my second-act career options, perhaps in a decade.  Purist IO-s will often knock both OD and coaching as being slightly woo-woo, and so they lose out on rich fields of study, though it's true without a focus on scientific method and ways of knowing, some consulting/coaching looks a little more faddish.

In my opinion there's a whole living breathing world of OD that makes what is covered at SIOP/ in I-O news each year look wan and pale.  The good stuff sometimes happens if you get a good panelist of people who can combine analytics and OD.  If you really want to see the breadth of the OD field, get off SIOP and this reddit check out some of these resources:

For generalist consulting:

- Find the right timing for the application cycle - you will be eligible for some firm's advanced degree application process, but they start over a year before you may be done

- Attend information sessions and anything hosted by your school's consulting clubs, there may be something for graduate students but if not there is likely an MBA or undergrad group

- Follow the resume guidance in the  wiki

- Prepare for interviews using free online courses, publicly available case books, and partners who have gone through the interview process before

- Meet with people if desired, but it doesn't make a huge impact on getting the job. if someone were to do a referral, it doesn't skip over any steps. it simply ensures that a recruiter sees your application (which would happen anyways in the advanced degree application cycle)

This can be done by reading more practice-oriented things and networking with practitioners to get a better sense of what sorts of academic things are actionable. Attend the SIOP conference and attend practice-oriented sessions. Keep in mind that psychologists are not the only kind of practitioners.

On the other hand. If full wellbeing programs are implemented, with regular measurements, change in policies around WFH more leave days, together with trainings, courses etc. There must be some effect.

And you must also be able to measure the ROI of that. According to Philips though there are a lot of misconceptions on measuring ROI. That it is too expensive, impossible to measure. And then there are political fears that certain efforts might not be that effective and this might reflect on certain departments etc.

Maybe the skepticism on their effects combined with the misconceptions on measuring ROI and the inherent challenges might be reason to not measure at all?

I'm all about growing the IO community! It would just be bad if we encouraged people into it for the wrong reasons - if they hate it due to misconceptions, then they'll not be a good influence for future IOs.

You COULD start your own IO practice, especially if you find others who are interested or you pick a narrow niche like small business consulting - though this isn't the must lucrative option especially early on.

You can study IO as a passion or hobby without making it your career as well, though I'd recommend doing this without a uni. Just buy textbooks and read articles solo if you're not going to use it professionally as loans aren't worth it if there's little to no ROI (assuming you're in the US or a similar country). Tbh I'd recommend doing this regardless to see if you enjoy the study enough to consider it seriously.

Work experience also helps a lot. Get into HR with your bachelor's and then go for your masters imo. I didn't do this and even getting a entry level HR job is, yikes. You'd think HR would understand transferable skills but...?

Is your bachelor's in IO? Because that's rare - also why IO? What job are you targeting after graduation? Is there a more specific degree for that job, and does that degree meet your needs? E.g. want HR specifically? Why not get a degree in HR? I didn't because I wanted to focus specifically on the psych of motivation and psychometrics. Oh and about your degree choice - be VERY cautious about your university choice, talk to alumni of the specific program - I'm not sure how common it is, but there are some IO degree mills out there that push shit political ideologies like it's some crap sociology degree = stick with the big names if you don't want to do the research, accreditation doesn't mean a whole lot.

To be fair I was also totally blind sided by how difficult this field would be to find work, average reported income + field growth rate does not indicate this problem at all but it's also a widely mentioned thing on this forum, so you're already doing more than I did. ""Lies, damn lies, and statistics"".

Things are, apparently changing for the field according to the reported field growth rates and the occasional normie already knowing what it is - but it's a slow thing that isn't likely to be gone by the time you finish your MA.",1_1_1

Radford is a big name, and was one I personally considered - NCState and George Mason too. Don't worry about those schools, I hear really good things about all of them. And Y.E.S. network your ass off, go in person if you do go. If you do decide to go IO, I'll happily set you up with contacts to start you off too.

But you're keep mentioning analytics, and then kinda IO as a ""I like it because it does some analytics but it has alternatives"" and... Well I'm not sure that's a good approach. No one really knows IO, and for most jobs a analytics degree will be picked over you without a second glance unless you have some experience or something else they like.

Basically... Another degree won't solve your issues unless you're specifically striving for a job that requires it, need an edge on the competition, or have a passion to do it regardless.=M=M IO is a super interesting field, but you're not mentioning anything about the field, other than our slight connection to analytics... And gen psyc already does that, and we'd be out selected by other fields in that industry for their 1:1 fit and the name recognition. (CS, BA, BI, Stats...)

Also don't listen to downers about your undergrad degree... (Fun fact, philosophy majors on average make more than business majors in industry after 10 years).

Most jobs require a bachelor's but don't even list what it needs to be in, since they're all liberal arts focused and have transferable skills. Yes, a targeted degree helps; and YES there are exceptions - account is all but required for a job in accounting past the book keeping level. But for most office jobs? Doesn't matter. Emphasize the skills your degree got you, and what else you bring to the table and keep trying. Try it before you buy it! Emphasize your research methods and stats course you'd have taken in undergrad. You're in the same boat as you would be with an IO masters for a entery level analytics job. Heck go for an internship. If you like it, then decide how to advance in that industry...

Please do not sink yourself in debt if you don't have a strong business case or a TON of passion.

If you're struggling to get into analytics (as you say you want to, rather than IO specifically or a sub analytics field that would benefit more from IO like PA) go get a certification rather than a multi thousand dollar degree that'll take years.

* Take my advice with a grain of salt, since what works for one person may not work for another, and let your interests guide you. If you don't care much about personnel selection  but leadership fascinates you, then read and learn accordingly.

* The most helpful resources usually aren't available as audiobooks (academic papers, textbooks, course lectures, etc.).
* There are a decent number of 'popular press' books related to this topics, but mostly they will be less valuable than taking a course, reading a textbook, or reading research papers.
* *Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior* publications are helpful for getting a broad overview of an area.

Here are a smattering of papers from - *Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior*:

* Overqualification at Work: A Review and Synthesis of the Literature
* The Modeling and Assessment of Work Performance
* Compensation, Benefits, and Total Rewards: A Bird's-Eye (Re)View
* Measurement Development and Evaluation
* Differential Validity and Differential Prediction of Cognitive Ability Tests: Understanding Test Bias in the Employment Context
* Pay, Intrinsic Motivation, Extrinsic Motivation, Performance, and Creativity in the Workplace: Revisiting Long-Held Beliefs

Here are a few other papers that I have found particularly helpful or interesting:

* Arthur Jr, W., &amp; Villado, A. J. (2008). The importance of distinguishing between constructs and methods when comparing predictors in personnel selection research and practice. *Journal of Applied Psychology*, 93(2), 435.

IIRC, one key difference between network and factor analysis is that in latent variable modeling, the assumption is that the latent variable causes the variation among the measured variables. In network analysis, the assumption is that (for example, symptoms of depression), are mutually causal among each other and not caused by a latent variable. I believe that network analysis originally grew out of research in psychopathology.

Some other things to note--Hudson Golino has done research showing that his network psychometrics approach is better at recovering the factor structure compared to exploratory factor analysis. However, even in his work, if you do recover a potential factor structure using network psychometrics, you would verify this factor using CFA.",2

To answer your question  

Factor analysis is based on the assumption that the observed variables (item responses) are only related given some underlying latent variables/factors. These factors represent common dimensions that account for the shared variance among the items. Factor analysis aims to identify these latent factors and determine how strongly each observed variable is related to them. The goal is to simplify the complex relationships among variables by identifying a smaller set of underlying factors.

Psychometric network analysis, on the other hand, is based on the idea that psychological constructs emerge from the interactions between variables rather than being reducible to a smaller set of latent factors. In this framework, items are treated as nodes in a network, and the connections between nodes represent the direct relationships among these variables, typically controlling for all other variation from all other connections. The focus is on understanding the structure and dynamics of the network itself. Psychometric networks use techniques from network science, which attempts to estimate the structure, dynamics, and complexity of graphical models, to estimate the connections between variables and to identify clusters of highly interconnected variables. Measures like centrality (i.e., identifying important nodes or clusters within the network) and modularity are used to characterize the network and to understand its organization. Psychometric networks do not inherently assume underlying latent factors, but its flexible in that you can set the network to have latent factors and explore whether or not the network is justifiable given latents. Networks can achieve unity to factor models given their flexibility as well.",3

I love that you are interested in IO psychology but I really don't want you to waste a bunch of money on an online program and leave not having the skills and knowledge you actually need to make the career transition you're hoping for. Not to mention you say that it's a new program that hasn't graduated anyone meaning you'll have basically no alumni network to help you make connections in the field AND you have no real sense of the success rate of graduates. I would compare the curriculum of this program really critically with other high quality programs to make sure you would be getting what you are looking for.

To some of your other questions, tons of IOs work in consulting. Given your background you might even be able to find success building a niche around applying IO principles specifically in IT environments. All industries need IOs, but it's generally the big companies that can afford to hire us. There's plenty of IOs working in oil &amp; gas.

Professors will always be those with Ph.Ds in the field, but there are some M.As who teach adjunct. Doesn't pay that well though so it's not that common",1

Generally though you can get into consulting with just a masters of any kind, however you will have to sell yourself more (which I dont think would be a problem for you). There are some forms of consulting/some firms which only hire PhDs. To be frank though you only *need* the PhD if you want to continue to pursue academia.

I agree with what others have said in that I am not confident the program you described will best set you up for success, especially in this job market. When I worked internally, I was responsible for hiring for our entry-level IO roles. In all honesty, we never considered someone from an online program. And this was not at all because the program was simply online. This was because the candidates from online programs did not have the same level of research and applied experience as those coming from research-based, in-person programs. I worked at a relatively small company, but wed still get 100s of applications per role. We always had competitive candidates to choose from that had lab experience and experience working on applied consulting projects (usually in partnership with their grad programs). Although the candidates from online schools had the right classes, their IO experience typically ended there. Even though I work 100% remotely and have worked remotely for almost my entire career (starting many years before Covid), I do not think online IO programs have at this point been built to provide the same opportunities as traditional in-person programs. I fully acknowledge that online programs are more easily accessible - especially for working professionals - but you may end up spending considerable time and money on something to see little return - not only financially, but you may also not end up with the career change you are expecting. 

I do fully support your interest in IO and would recommend attending the annual SIOP conference and signing up for the Conference Career Center if you do end up pursuing IO. SIOP also posts IO jobs on their website. Many companies begin recruiting for interns or entry-level roles in November-January to start in May/June. The biggest thing you can do to help obtain that first role is networking. Everyone always says that the IO world is small (even though there are thousands of IO psychologists), and connecting with the right people can be the difference between getting a job or not. Of course, thats true in any field, but it seems to be particularly true in the IO field.",4

I've seen many articles for example provide practical, actionable recommendations that are essentially invented out of clear air and have little bearing on the actual findings of the study they ostensibly come from.

This is part of why Tara Behrend and I wrote this textbook (due out in April): [https://www.routledge.com/Research-Methods-for-Industrial-and-Organizational-Psychology-Science-and/Landers-Behrend/p/book/9781138052932](https://www.routledge.com/Research-Methods-for-Industrial-and-Organizational-Psychology-Science-and/Landers-Behrend/p/book/9781138052932)

The short of it is that good scientific methods are multidimensional and contingent on many different factors that are only sometimes relevant. The only way to know if a particular finding is trustworthy is to apply your knowledge of all those factors. It is not something easily distilled into a checklist or soundbites. Hopefully that's not what you are after.

Where Im currently at, the main difference between HR and I/O is that the I/Os are responsible for surveying, data analysis, and the broader parts of our very lengthy assessment centers (assessor training, calibration exercises, debriefing, etc).

HR does a lot of the heavy lifting on all the other items, although I/Os pitch in a bit. Notably, on my team, they serve as facilitators during our assessment centers, working closely with assessors to address any questions or issues scoring candidates.

I definitely want to keep the science part of the science-practitioner model, as I feel that's what separates us from most fields.

I think I was having a pretty bad identity crisis for a bit. I'm still going to be working on the promotions team and still likely going to be a part of or in charge of some of the heavier analytical parts of the job. I was afraid of my skills going dull or being very mediocre at the role, hence why I went back for my PhD to delve into topics and stay sharpened. 

It looks like I'm at that point now where I get to see my role evolve, yet I'm surprised since I've had very straightforward selection and assessment roles for a while now. I am probably just afraid of change and overthinking. Thanks for this!",5_1

Don't wait. You have a Master's and 3 years of work experience under your belt. Go get what's yours.

If it was me, I would hold off on getting a certification for now because it would just eat up time and money for something that's not a guaranteed value-add. If you're going into consulting, the Statement of Work would list out contract requirements for a specified certification or sometimes wouldn't require key personnel to hold one at all. Many firms would also offer tuition reimbursement as part of their compensation package, so you don't have to spend all of your own dime. If you have your SHRM-CP or PHR already, that's another story. I know some colleagues that pursued certification after they've decided to dedicate their career to consulting for a specific topic (ATD for Learning and Development, for example).",1

When you change questions you lose that ability. That said, you should be able to tweak questions and still have the correlate to what you're trying to match it to but you need to be careful about it and make sure you don't change the meaning.

Now if you don't care about benchmarking externally you can ask just about anything you want but it will take a few rounds for you to be able to male an internal benchmark for that question.

They are a great survey platform that allow you to compare results with other companies in your industry + other industries if youre interested. 

They use the Q12 which is a highly researched set of 12 questions based on a hierarchy of employee needs that drive engagement. 

I think you can also add your own set of questions in addition to the Q12.

Gallup also evaluated the data and creates action plans for each department. Then, you can work with different teams or leaders to get more granular on the action plans to make them more effective. 

OP, whatever you do, whatever survey platform you use, the action plans are the most important piece. If the data isnt utilized and applied in a way that makes sense to leaders and teams, the surveys are pointless. You can apply a few umbrella action plans for an entire company based on the more pressing engagement drivers, but work with different departments to identify how they can make it their own, or if theyd like to apply another plan as well.",3

The left column is the questions, the second is the yeses, and the third is the nos.  They're anonymous, so what exactly will you do with that data? And if HR manages the show, what happens when a leader says ""no"" to a recommendation? That's pretty much the end of that one. The universal problem with EE/EX initiatives is HR.

They are good, maybe not great though, but the companies I've been with have been \~500 employees and I could see Energage being better if we'd had a larger budget/appetite.

They offer decent benchmarking, which you definitely DO want if you want to understand your org's engagement compared to others in your industry - and they offer advisory support (consultants) to help you understand your results. (Or, if you have an internal data nerd, they'll be able to make sense of it themselves like I did! If they have other FT duties, maybe don't ask them to do this though... just saying. =) With Energage, surveying your employees (and participating in the Top Workplaces running if you choose to) is free; seeing your results is not. Advisory services are an additional cost, which we did not opt for.  I thiiiink they can help with action plans too, not too sure on that one BUT they do have ""action planning templates"" with some tracking, but we didn't use those either. Small org/small team running with this, etc.

Having led my org's engagement data + efforts for the past 3 years, I'm curious to know what sort of tailored questions you are looking for and what questions were confusing. In my mind, a good engagement survey is broad enough to apply pretty universally. For ours, our exec team initially wanted to change a few questions/make them company-specific also, but I was able to consult + help them understand what those questions were truly trying to uncover.

I actually really appreciate their anonymity thresholds - we asked to reorganize some of our data and they needed to check that our request met these requirements before making our updates to make sure they preserved anonymity.

The closest you can get to identifying anything is group-level. So, depending on how you set up your structure (they can help with this), if enough people respond to a thing, you will be able to see how your Marketing department responded (for example) - but only if enough people *in* Marketing completed the survey. If not, it will come back as ""an employee"" or the parent-level if there is one. I'm in construction so for example, my parent-level would be field teams, and a sub-level would be pipefitters. If I don't get enough responses from my pipefitters, I won't be able to see their results as a group - they would be absorbed into the larger parent group, which in my case would be field teams.

The thresholds are all hard numbers, not percentages of your group, and they are different depending on the type of feedback. For multiple choice options, I think the threshold is 7 responses from that group. The threshold is higher elsewhere (open-ended comments and overall engagement; two different response requirements) but I don't recall what they are.

But to be very clear, at no point will anyone at my company be able to see what responses I, darlingminerva, submitted as an employee, even after buying and receiving all of our data.

It's asking for 6 years with a Master's degree. But you can maybe compensate if you demonstrate strong data analysis skills - particularly in research design and data interpretation that leads to actionable strategies. If you were in a lab, emphasize your responsibilities in leading group(s) of undergrad R.A.s. If there was any company outreach as part of your coursework (where you had to connect with some business locally for an applied project). The point is to demonstrate that you've physically handled this in some capacity. Definitely put the words ""end-to-end"" somewhere in the resume; definitely mention something about talking to ""senior leadership"" or briefing them on status updates and findings (if you've actually done that or something similar of course, don't just make up stuff). When the time is right...the range listed in the ad - aim for just over $100k+ as you have your Master's. Or fuck it, just shoot for the stars but make it sound like it's not a concrete figure. Find out about that 401(k) plan.

Also look into: ""[Learning and Development](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=learning+and+development&amp;l=West+Virginia&amp;vjk=5d26d8af90e28ea4)"", ""[Organizational Change Management](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Organizational+Change+Management&amp;l=West+Virginia&amp;vjk=0e47bc1e00b3a831)"", People Analytics or Data Analytics (if you're into the Data Science/Modeling more), etc. You're not gonna get a supervisor or director role for the time being, but don't completely discount them either. Check out any local MBB, Big 4, or even boutique firms in your area.

**This is not a strategy that will guarantee you this job.** Just my two cents from what I went through and what some of my cohorts did. The idea is that you can figure out ways to remain competitive, given that you have a Master's degree and possess the competencies they are looking for. There's still always the possibility that they are really hard up on that Years of Experience requirement, or a random responsibility pop up out of nowhere, but you're not as bad off as you'd think.

Plus, (again depending on the company) there can be many opportunities to cross collaborate and get project experience doing what you want to do with those more specialized teams (giving you the necessary work experience in those areas).

Basically, I think it wouldn't hurt you to take a broad HR role, but looking for companies who care to provide development and cross functional experiences would be key. Making sure you leverage your education in the process is the biggest thing in your favor, of course =

Naturally, how likely the organization is to accept you will vary massively depending on the specifics of that organization.
* Local non-profits are always an option. Volunteering for *Small and Unknown Organization* doesn't build your resume as much as an internship for a Fortune 100 company, but it is a valid option, and maybe the best option you'll have.

A lot of I/O roles will end up doing non-I/O things from time to time. I don't have a big problem with this as long as I can shift back into my field when it's time. There definitely needs to be a balancing act however, or else you're forced to find a new job.

I feel your pain though.

A consulting firm might suit you. I am a little biased against consulting in general, as my last consulting firm was hyper degenerate, but at least they were focused on developing and running assessment centers constantly.

Every week, I was either administering an assessment center or I was developing assessments or job analyses for clients. Well, until my boss decided that I should also be a full-time admin assistant and expected me to work 60-70 hours a week, driving all over the place, for a substandard salary and company with her plague rat cousin. But, otherwise, it was a pure I/O role in theory.

I just did most of the work that I can with our engagement survey (which was conducted before I was onboarded), and now that I have breathing room, I'm spending my time supporting our human capital and talent management team with more mundane things that really don't require an I/O degree.

As a matter of fact, literally yesterday, I asked my mentor (the only other I/O at my agency of about 11,000, for reference) if the work she did was standard in the federal government. That is to say, did she really moonlight as an I/O psychologist while spending most of the day basically supporting the team by doing bulky tasks that fell more under HR work. She said, ""not sure if this is typical, but probably.""

My guess is this: the larger a percentage of I/Os at an organization, the more likely you are to stay doing I/O things. Unfortunately, I think the field is at a stage where companies finally need us, yet they either don't know this yet or don't know how to go about implementing this. So you end up with a few I/Os who take on that big I/O project or two before going back to busywork.",1

Here are my observations about typical IO jobs, but take them with a grain of salt.

In the public sector (i.e., government jobs), you'll get a lot more stability in terms of job security and work duties. What you see in the job posting is what you get. You won't have a lot of those pesky ""miscellaneous"" job tasks fall onto you. You get decent benefits including holidays. The pay is fine, but not great. I've personally found these jobs harder to get - IO jobs don't pop up too often, especially if you're not already working in government. (Note: The USAJOBS website has gotten easier to use for applying to federal jobs, but I've found it to be confusing and frustrating in the past)

In the private sector, you have a **huge** range of jobs that will vary in things like pay, benefits, career growth, and the types of work you do. Unfortunately, a lot of IOs fall into a role that is tangentially related to their IO interests, but like you, lose that grasp with few or no IO peers in the company. You also have more risk of layoffs. Based on my own personal observations and preferences, I think the best companies to work for have a strong &amp; established IO presence. You'll have advocates and internal stakeholders who value what you bring to the table. I would look around and see what companies employ a lot of IOs. I personally look at how much representation companies have at the SIOP conference. Ask around, network, and find out where your alumni and extended network are at, and how big their Data Science, Performance Management, Org Design, Selection Assessment, etc. teams are. When you're alone on an IO island, it can be a lot harder to get buy-in and do the work you're passionate about, as you've already discovered.

In consulting, I've found the work varies mainly based on the size of the firm. The big consulting firms have a lot more prestige and pay a lot more, but at the cost of a lot of hours, a lot of stress, and being put on a project for months or years that you may or may not be passionate about. They also tend to require a higher business acumen than a lot of IOs possess, so they generally look more toward MBAs. Smaller consulting firms or IO type vendors (i.e., assessments for selection or leadership development) will give you a lot of IO-relevant work, but potentially at the cost of gaining a wider breadth of skills. You might be hyper-focused on things like survey design and analysis, which can sound appealing to the right person, but it may stunt your career growth if you eventually want to expand beyond that. You may also be more involved in sales and client management, which again may or may not be appealing.

My general career advice is to sit down with your manager and talk about what's working well for you and what isn't. Since you don't really care about leaving this job, you might as well be candid about how you're feeling and what you want to do in your role. If they have the resources to shift that boring work to other people so you can pursue more interesting work, great. If not, you should start looking around. I expect that companies looking to hire graduating IOs will see your additional experience as an advantage over other candidates. I'd start reaching out to your network and any other IOs you know to get their advice and get the scoop on where they're working. Find out what they would do if they were in your shoes. I personally wouldn't leave your current role without one lined up, but I'd absolutely be looking. And if you're willing to relocate, you have a lot more opportunities, so keep that in mind as well.

Unfortunately, you'll find bureaucracy at pretty much every workplace. Smaller companies will have less, but you may have to take on more ""boring"" work as a result of needing to wear more hats. I personally think doing nothing but engagement surveys would be a drag, but I definitely empathize with not wanting to be a recruiter plus an L&amp;D coordinator in addition to your regular role.",2

When I wanted to leave my boutique consulting firm, one thing I found tough to deal with was just demonstrating my growth for non-selection roles. They knew what kind of work I did if they were IOs, so BSing only got me so far.

The gap appears when the *pacing* of the fieldwork doesn't match the research that's constantly being generated.

We're starting to examine organizational phenomenons at a very nuanced level. For example, we're not just studying ""Leadership"" or ""Hiring"" or ""Statistical Analysis""...we're looking at how leadership styles influence turnover intentions or revisiting the validity of specific selection methodologies or observing the impact of mediating moderators and moderating mediators, etc...

...Things that are way too specific and advanced for business stakeholders who simply want to control their workforce, fill in an empty spot on their team, or just want to look at pretty numbers in a PowerPoint presentation. The work is made that much harder when there's only one (maybe two) IOs in the organization. Speaking as one such practitioner, I often run into the wall in having to walk MBAs and HRs through basic concepts like weighted ratings or job analysis or training efficacy; and having them understand those concepts is what will keep the wheels moving and actually get something done.

I would love to use more of the materials and resources that come out of conferences and journal articles, and I'm even willing to (and had developed the skills to be capable of) distill them down to laymen terms for my audience. But I also have to prepare myself and know that it will take a lot of work and mental energy to actualize those findings.

* I/O psych isn't cut-and-dry. If we hold ourselves up to the standard of clinical psychologists (which we should), there is plenty of room for professional judgment. Clinicians are always encouraged to work within the confines of evidence but to bring their unique judgment to every single client. This may mean one strays away from the rigid confines of what some systematic review says or the practice manuals. Psychology is a social science, and the quality of our relationships is a big part of what determines our success, regardless of the model or theory we use. And with organisations, it's even more complex; there are so many contingencies and stakeholders to consider.
* We need to consider many different types of evidence, especially in intervention contexts. Of course, we structure our models and strategies on the best available meta-analysis and systematic reviews out there. And, of course, we gather hard data and soft data to generate a more complete picture of the psychosocial patterns at our firm of interest. But, the hard data are great, but listening to people's stories may reveal more than the numbers alone. Nothing goes linearly; you have to adapt and make the best of what data you have (or don't have!). Sometimes what really gets you over the line is a town-hall style Q&amp;A and not the engagement survey. Sometimes the data that aren't there tell more of a story than the data you do have. This is where our professional judgment as practitioners overrides the strictures of the scientist. We're not working in a clean laboratory where all the confounds are accounted for and scraped clean. We're working in a living experiment (firms). So we have to be agile!
* A really great [article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2016.1156672) I return to often to remind ourselves of the high standards we should aspire to, but also the concrete reality we must work with!:
   * This study explores the extent to which work and organizational (W&amp;O) psychology practitioners use evidence, how they apply it to the everyday contexts in which they work, and the types of barriers they encounter in so doing. It adopts a mixed methods approach involving the administration of a survey to a UK sample (N = 163) of W&amp;O psychologists and a series of semi-structured interviews (N = 25) exploring in greater depth how evidence is applied in practice. **Findings reveal that practitioners consult a wide range of different types of evidence which they employ at various stages of engagement with client organizations and that this evidence is pressed into service in the pursuit of solutions which are both acceptable from the client perspective and consistent with the scientific standards underpinning professional knowledge and expertise in W&amp;O psychology. Barriers to evidence-use were mainly practical in nature, concerning issues around managing the clientconsultant relationship and the particularities of implementation context, both of which were shown to influence evidence utilization.** The study contributes to current debate on the extent to which W&amp;O psychologists adopt an evidence-based approach and provides a valuable and much called-for empirical insight into the enactment of the scientistpractitioner model in W&amp;O psychology.

My experience is that it really doesnt matter. Other I/Os already in the workforce will look at your school and maybe make one comment, then move on to see if you have the competencies for the job. 

Ive been hired at two different places now since graduating at the end of 2021. I received offers for many more. I live in DC, where I work with and compete for jobs against George Mason, University of Maryland, and other graduates left and right. Nobody looks down on me for going online.

Im interning with the federal government currently as I work on an online PhD. Nobody cares that Im doing it that way, either. If they do care, it hasnt impacted my ability to secure multiple interviews or even an offer, not to my knowledge.

The key point is that Im still living in an area healthy for I/O growth and doing my due diligence.

Also, I had an MSc already so knew that having the MPhil would not be quite so great. Having a doctorate really stands for something.

From a job perspective, having a Masters is great but having a PhD makes you stand out.

Best choice I ever made. You do have to be a go-getter and willing to put yourself out there for opportunities rather than hope things will come to you. I advocated for myself to find good roles and worked hard sometimes 60 hour weeks at my job to get aggressive raises. 3 years out of school I make 6 figures.

If you are a little more passive/introverted i think it would be a lot harder.

If you would feel more comfortable with the weight of a PhD behind you which more people understand as a valuable credential or may be better to go for the PhD. 

Then again - last time i met up with my cohort I make more per year than 4 out of the 4 who completed the PhD, so a lot of it is about your drive and marketing of yourself too.

First of all, there aren't very many masters programs in I/O Psychology. Most programs are Ph.D. programs. Because of that, masters programs tend to be second-rate. This isn't the case at MTSU, where they made an effort to ensure that its graduates receive the best possible training.

Most of the classes involve a real-life project of some kind where you work with local businesses or other organizations to get hands-on I/O consulting experience. By the time you graduate, you already have experience working in the field. On top of this, the program requires an internship, a thesis, and comprehensive exams. Most masters-level I/O programs only require one of those, so this ensures that you're prepared no matter what direction you want to take after you graduate.

I haven't looked at the stats in many years, but when I graduated, MTSU I/O Psychology alumni had some of the best career placements out of any I/O Psychology program. If you want to go for a Ph.D., there are better options, but for a terminal masters program, MTSU is hard to beat.

EDIT: When I said there weren't many masters programs, I meant masters-only. Many places with a Ph.D. program also offer a masters, but there aren't many places that offer only a masters like MTSU.

For example, cybersecurity will want experience related to indicent response who can use data science tools, I/Os often want large scale survey or assessment instrument experience with knowledge of applying analytics/statistics to the findings. This is not a rule and there are definitely exceptions. 

You can learn data science as you learn another profession simultaneously, especially if you focus your interests on data science skills in grad school.

I felt into it with a few temporary contract gigs. I also went after places that my cohorts also went to, mostly small businesses that are looking to fulfill a specific single function for the contract. It took a while, and my cohorts and I had to pass through a lot of nonsense recruiter hoops to get in. 

&gt;Strategies to leverage an I/O degree when most firms prioritize MBAs.

This is why I went with places that have already accepted my cohorts and people with similar degrees. This will always be a struggle, and you're going to see a lot of newer professionals with MBA leapfrogging over you in some places. For some reason, organizations really covet MBAs even though they're really not as strong as IO Psych or related OD fields.

If I see that the job posting is specifically asking for ""Master's in IO Psych or related fields"", I know my chances are good. If the website really lays out that specific language (IYKYK), they're likely to understand where you came from and what your competencies are.

&gt;Networking and application tactics that have worked for you.

Nothing. I've tried lots of different things over the years and it's hit or miss. I've also become the guy that people ""network"" with as they look for jobs, and I try to help as much as I can. But at the end of the day, anything that's done in this area is spotty at best. 

I've simply maintained good and constant contacts with the people I went to school with and worked with, kept my ears to the ground and prompt them every so often. Real, actual, organic networking. This can generate some leads but there's no guarantee.",6

From the examples you have here, I will say that GenAI makes for a pretty terrible chatbot, we are partnering with a different service for that. 

I like the survey comment summary idea, I'd be shocked if we don't see that integrated into Qualtrics and other survey playforms in the near future. Would want to be careful that the survey data fed in is anonymized and scrubbed of any personally identifying information.

The resume thing is tough for us. There's so much personally identifiable information as well as information which could elicit bias in resumes, it raises some AI ethics concerns but we are exploring ways to work with them safely for GenAI.",1

I've been approached to discuss ways that AI can support this kind of effort. It's usually from folks that are mainly in tech and not so much IO/OB/OD/HRM (maybe some experience with HR). They're hoping that AI will solve the problem by analyzing and interpreting resumes and other applicant submissions better. Inevitably, they expose that the goal is to simply do it faster and maybe in a greater depth, but not necessarily better in terms of a more valid interpretation that match organizational needs. Essentially, they want to create a tech product that will simply allow employers to feed resumes into a machine rather than read it themselves.

IMO, that desire is the big obstacle. We've already assumed that people just can't do it well (even though there are techniques to mitigate risks and biases already - it's just that nobody is applying it), and we want AI to be our savior.

The other critical piece is using the Skills function effectively. This is the epitome of LinkedIn fuck-fuck games, but most recruiters working in fields that they don't understand will use a simple skill keyword match between the candidate and role as a critical first hurdle. Folks looking for jobs and internships should be looking at the keywords associated with the kinds of jobs that interest them on LinkedIn. Once you have a list of the Skill keywords that keep popping up, then add a Skills section to your own account that includes those kinds of Skill terms. You should also revise your About Me at the top of your profile to include ~5 of the really key Skill terms that you want to emphasize on a quick skim.

One, there is no such thing as a statistical change. Either the mean score of the group you are interested in tracking has changed in the population or it hasnt (although more technically - it almost always has), and either you have a large enough sample size to detect that change or you dont.

For example, if you were actually administering your survey to the entire population, you have 100% power to detect literally any change, and alpha is in effect set at zero, because you have data from literally everyone.  No statistical/inferential test required.

Two, those effect sizes are not sample size dependent, but your accuracy in estimating them is. So if you have a target effect size that matters to you (e.g., a decrease of more than 0.5 SD is a problem wed want to follow up on), then you should set that as your target effect size for everything youre planning. If that number is higher or lower for different populations, such as a higher turnover risk group, then maybe you set that target smaller. But this decision should be independent of power needs.

Three, my guess is that you are making power calculations based on a hypothetical infinite population rather than a concrete one, because power estimate larger than the population is not conceptually possible for the reasons outlined in point one above. Most academic researchers are interested in hypothetical infinite populations, like all employees anywhere ever. You are not. So you do not need to use the same formulas - they will assume you are trying to generalize to a much larger population than the one you actually care about.

Four, there is no standard desired level for power. It is instead a matter of risk tolerance. How much risk are you willing to accept given the resources you need to put into your study? 80% power is where academic researchers have landed as good enough. But for real decision making, Id want something higher. The same is true of alpha - I generally prefer .01 in practice (assuming NHST is worthwhile in the first place - it often isnt). You can see this same logic in classic psychometric texts - lower power and higher alpha are okay for research, but less so for real decision making, especially when someones job is on the line.",1

The fact of the matter is that most experimental conditions just don't make that big of a difference.  If you can find a similar construct or intervention with literature that shows an effect size of 0.5, then selecting an effect size of 0.5 would be acceptable.  Generally though, I'd assume your effect size would be smaller.",2

Do you mean 9 more or less random samples from the entire company or 9 different groups within the company, e.g., different departments? In the latter case I would look at the annual results for that department and then compare it to later pulse surveys for that department and not try to generalize from one department to the entire organization. A question is whether differences are due to sampling error, and that can be tested. If you fail to find a statistically significant difference, you could wonder if it is due to lack of power, and power analysis could shed some light there.

If you find in the annual survey that there are no statistically significant differences among the departments, you might conclude that you do not have 9 populations, but that all departments are from a single population. In that case, you could take random samples for a pulse survey and compare to the entire company to look for change.

The appropriate effect size to select for the power analysis is best chosen based on how large a difference would be meaningful and gets into the issue of utility. If you are evaluating a training program, for example, and want to know if it produced change, how much did the training program cost and how much value is there in the change (assuming there was change)? The answer to this can be complicated as not everything can be translated into money.",3

If you are doing pulse surveys regularly, then you can combine results across them for greater ability to detect differences. For example, suppose your department as 200 employees.

You are correct that a master's or PhD is essentially required for an IO career (with a very small handful of exceptions); however, you can apply into a PhD program to begin immediately after your bachelor's degree is complete. You do not need an existing master's degree to apply to PhD programs. In fact, most PhD students probably do not have existing master's. Straight from undergrad is most common, these days.

Importantly, master's programs will almost always charge you to attend them, whereas good PhD programs will pay your tuition for you, plus a (very) small salary on top of that, typically in exchange for your working as a teaching assistant. It does you no good to pay your way through a master's degree first if the PhD is where you will end up anyway.",1

If the plan is to go into IO, it makes more sense to major in psych rather than business. Most IO programs are looking for a solid foundation in psychology (especially research methods, stats, social psych, and cognitive psych) rather than a general business background. There's also a huge bonus if you can get psych research experience as an undergrad.

@OP If the idea is to go business over psych because you want more non-IO options, that's fine, but I definitely wouldn't recommend going business if you're pretty confident in wanting to go into IO. I understand the hesitancy of getting a BA in psychology without a clear plan of what you're going to do with it and why a business degree is more attractive. 

Also, I'll throw in my two cents that getting a minor is pretty useless. Feel free to get one in any area for your own personal interests or if it lines up well with your coursework, but a minor generally means nothing to grad schools or employers. A double major would be worth it if you it's feasible because it's much more impressive. Most minors don't require enough depth (i.e., advanced courses), making them pretty worthless imo.

Accounting, for example, has very little to do with IO and not very transferable skills - however it could land you a good job right out of undergrad to help pay for your graduate degrees. 

Other than accounting the other major business disciplines are very useful to an IO. Management is the obvious choice, however most management programs will have an emphasis on case studies and what seems to work by correlation and good vibes - this is largely subsumed by what you'll be doing in an IO program - but employers recognize the degree (but there is a TON of competition so watch out) for these reasons if I were to start again I wouldn't choose management.

Economics I think has the most to do with complementing IO by contrasting what you'll study but I forsee there being issues with employment with an econ degree as there's not many known traditional entry level jobs. But this is only my suspicion and far out of my wheelhouse so do your own research here.

Finance is great because it's easily recognized by employers, gets you decent work as far as I know, and can be applied to implementing your IO programs - something you don't get a lot of in grad school. Business owners will look at your nice proposal for some engagement thing and be like ""why do I care?"" Not because they're heartless but because they think in terms of ROI. Finance let's you communicate with business owners, and gets you a great backup career. However it will not help you in grad school, and with this degree especially school name matters big time - it's a no outsiders club for the high end work.

Data analysis is a top tier choice! Easily recognized by a ton of businesses - the big ones who traditionally employ IOs too - so easy to get your foot in, if you work part time while getting your MA. Especially with entry level jobs in data analysis. Additionally, paired with a HR cert you could easily work through grad school as a HR Analyst. What you'll study will largely help you with your work as an IO, when it comes to analyzing survey results or understanding where the last poor sap from HR with no IO training got their numbers.

Tbh a psych under grad is fascinating stuff, but doesn't really do much other than open your eyes to what all is out there. The only courses I think are necessary to take as an IO is really the research methods, statistics, writing methods, type courses. You don't need cognitive or sensation for most subdisciplines of IO. BUT this is generic advice, doesn't mean that you won't love those classes or want to do one of the subfields that use them.

I know this seems counter intuitive - because you'd think you'd want to keep walking the same path into io specializing further into the field. But I think diversification of your education is far more useful, especially since any self respecting PhD program should cover everything you'll miss along the traditional route. A lot of people come from random backgrounds into a MAIOP program, one dude in my program was an education major, another communication, another gender-psychology... Point is anything can get you in if you have the right application. You may have to work harder to catch up, but you'll also have a different perspective to offer and hopefully better employment prospects. Build a pyramid, not a flag pole, you can always learn more after you graduate - in fact you better.

However if you choose a non io background for grad school, you NEED to strengthen your application. Do really well on the GRE, conduct psych research through your undergrad professors, have internships etc.",8

Anecdotally, I think past competitions had a lower barrier to entry. I think a combination of two things might overwhelm some folks when they first see the competition, possibly leading to some form of procrastination.

1.	`There has always been a ton of documentation and education around the models needed to participate in past competitions. For example, past competitions have been won with xgboost or embedding models, which have been around for a few years. There are plenty of examples of solving a vast array of problems using these models. For LLMs, although you can do a a whole lot more with minimal information - eg, chain models together, tweak prompts in a number of ways, fine tune different parts of an entire system of models, and so on - theres very little documentation on LLMs and how to get them to do stuff. It requires a lot more experimentation. This is why we wrote the primer, which I guess is even more time investment. So I think people might be a bit hesitant to really learn about LLMs with the extra time they have, possibly due to minimal documentation and higher learning curve since these kinds of models are so new and kind of weird relative to how weve setup ML solutions in the past. 
2.	`This years competition has multiple sub-challenges, which has never been done before and requires more effort. No single solution will work for all  sub-challenges, so each challenge has to be systematically addressed individually. Add that to the above problem, and itll take longer for people to start fully participating.

I think some context around questions like well, why LLMs? and why so many challenges? is that we wanted to keep in line with the tradition of innovation. We also wanted to raise the stakes since there are cash prizes involved. Since (non fine tuned) LLMs are general problem solvers, we thought it would be interesting to throw a host of problems to competitors to see where LLMs thrive and where they sink.",2_1

But most are more confident in their understanding than they actually are. You should be so comfortable and confident with them you wouldnt hesitate to teach a semester long course on it to undergrads, and all the questions that come with it. 

2. Get really, really good at a programming language like R or Python, specifically data manipulation. The majority of work I do ends up as reporting simple numbers - Im hardly ever running machine learning or advanced stuff. Its almost always having to clean very messy data, or combine different data sources to get the answer I need. This is what data analysis is like in the real world that school doesnt focus on at all. Get very comfortable cleaning dirty data and that will take you so much further than learning advanced stats. 

When and if you need an advanced statistical technique, its very easy to simply research some about it enough to use it provided you already have a solid foundation in statistics and programming.

That being said, even if your psych stat classes don't dive deep into the math, you'll have the prerequisite knowledge to learn the more advanced aspects of statistics on your own. 

&gt; I wont be using mathematical statistics in the field

Most people don't use mathematical statistics. But most Statistics majors require it as a course because that's where you start to truly learn how and why all these methods work. Never in your practical work will you ever be required to derive the normal equations for linear regression. But by diving into mathematical statistics, you'll have a richer and deeper understanding of how statistics works (compared to those who haven't taken such a course), and when you start learning new methods, you'll see how mathematical statistics really helps you grasp them (it's kind of hard to explain why that's the case, but that just seems to be the case).

There's also a lot of concern over ""face validity"". If applicants can't tell what the assessment is trying to test, then the test is ""bad"". But conveniently, they don't talk about the quality of the test when the question is so poorly written, that you can pick up on the measurement domains. Nobody cares about the content/construct/criterion validities.

Their preferred solution? Unstructured face-to-face interviews. Tests can't tell employers anything, you NEED to sit down with the person and have a conversation for ""cultural fit"". Alternatively, they love to dig up and pass around the answer key so people can ""beat the test"".

To be fair, part of the problem is that too many organization are still relying on unskilled employers and hiring team to find and administer these tests.

My standard recommendation is to secure an HR position somewhere, whether that be in talent acquisition, total rewards, HR admin, employee relations, or something else of the sort. From there, you can gain experience and begin discovering shortfalls in processes or areas for improvement. Build a solid portfolio of discovering and implementing changes and document the benefits that has provided for the company and the employee population. This would be great experience to leverage to move into an internal/external consulting or change management type position. From there, the I/O background is quite valuable.

If youre interested in working with data (Im quite biased here) I would say to try and find a HR operations analyst or WFM analyst position and do some experimental research in your spare time. Build and analyze some employee data and present your findings to your boss, if your findings are valuable and if you can generate some actionable next steps that is.

The whole idea is to be motivated, optimize, and improve customer and employee relationships. Its a great way to migrate your way into doing corporate research.

I think it's a very bad idea. They are two **very** different occupations and require **very** different trainings. The only transfer/overlap would be in basic psychology courses like research methods and statistics. I would strongly recommend against going into IO if your real interest and passion is in clinical. You'd be wasting a lot of time and money planning to transition careers from the get-go.

The closest you can get to clinical work in IO psychology is probably something like developmental coaching. BetterUp is one company that does that, but there are probably more.

Historically speaking industrial psychology comes from general psychology -&gt; Even today I know some clinical psychologist who dabble with industrial on the side a popular example of this is Jordan Peterson who has actively admitted on some of his interviews to have being brought on by businesses to do work that would clearly fall in the side of industrial psychology. If you'd like to talk to somebody who does this I can connect you on LinkedIn. 

Thing is we're going to use the same research methods and statistics But if you're willing to do your own reading after graduation you can just pick up on the most popular research findings within just a few textbooks and articles. There's no legal requirements regarding the title of industrial psychologist unlike a regular psychologist.

Basically, get your PhD in clinical psych (some unis even offer Io concentrations like this (iirc MSU is one)) - try it out and if it doesn't work out it would be far easier to go into IO rather than the other way around.

What might be even more beneficial is to get a MBA with a concentration in human resources or data analytics and a PhD in clinical psychology and just do IO that way. You can always get additional certifications or do more reading to shore up areas you're not certain about there are books on psychometrics and certifications that'll help a lot in this matter.

However. Maybe 10-15 years ago, IO got a lot of press about being one of the best paid career paths within psych. This led a lot of less-reputable institutions, mostly online only, to suddenly begin offering IO degrees despite having no IO faculty and having no connections to IO industry. These programs offered degrees with very little actual IO content - sometimes 1 IO class for example taught by a social psych, alongside a bunch of general psych courses. They also provided no pipelines into industry, which was standard practice in most in-person IO programs of the time.

When people started graduating from these programs, they had a hard time finding employment, because they never learned the skills that made IO valuable in the first place. When they did find jobs, it was often in generic HR roles that had little to do with IO. However because of their thin IO training, many of them did not even realize why this happened to them. That is the effect of predatory education.

This still happens today. The most extreme is not so common - most (but not all!) IO programs now have at least 1 faculty member with an IO background. But it should be 100% of IO courses taught by IOs! They also do a lot of other very destructive things with students, like insane advisee:advisor ratios (Ive heard as high as 40:1 which is horrifying), low IO expertise, and zero actual job prep. They often do things like tell you to talk to a generic school career placement service, which quite simply _does not work_ for IO jobs due to the highly network based and sub discipline siloed way the field works.

And honestly, if none of the people teaching in a program are themselves IOs with applied experience, why would they be qualified to help you become exactly that?

When you compare the experience to traditional brick and mortar IO masters programs - often something like 6+ courses in IO all taught by IOs, 3+ courses in stats and methods taught by quant specialists, applied consulting experiences built into coursework, IO advisors who provide personal skill and career mentoring with regular one on one meetings, and built in research opportunities - it is just not comparable. And when someone with THAT experience goes up for a job against someone who went to a predatory program, the traditional experience always wins. It is night and day in terms of skill development and field readiness.

All of that is to say if you want an IO masters, it provides little value at very high cost if you attend one of these degree mill programs, no matter the reason.",1

Then, develop the technical skills - graphic designing, building using different authoring tools, video editing. Start building your portfolio through personal interests or elearning challenges. Eventually you can try freelancing/interning to build your experience of talking to clients and analyzing content. After, you need to change companies and focus more on elearning opportunities. Note: Most of them would require samples / portfolio.

To actually conduct organizational research or consult in this area takes skill and expertise beyond data analytics. Knowing how to do analyses and other operations in R etc is a tool that we use as experts to conduct our research. The tool in and of itself is somewhat meaningless without enough subject matter expertise in both research design and many areas of org psych required to ask and answer the right questions, do meaningful research, properly consult on IO related issues. For example, I wouldnt consult in areas of clinical psych without proper expertise.

Keep in mind that IO impacts many peoples lives in an organization. Many times our work informs policies that impact thousands of individuals. And our recommendations must be legally defensiblewhich requires that you have expertise to know how a variety of IO decisions can hold up in court. I would seriously consider getting at least a masters if you want to enter the field. Promoting mental health at work is only a small sliver of what IOs are expected to advise on (and some not at all). I would advise against painting yourself an authority in the field as you are by definition not anymore an expert in IO as I am in clinical.

If you are looking for a start, I would read Applied psychology in Human Resource Management by Cascio &amp; Aguinis. At a minimum you should be knowledgeable about every chapter in that book.",1

On one hand I appreciate that you took the time to say I need to expand my knowledge base before jumping into this pool  thats certainly a good thing and I appreciate that you did that. 

But I also have (the mixed side) some feelings about the lack of desire to pursue another degree. That is 100% something that in general would not be permissible for most IO folk who wanted to get into clinical  they would have to go back and earn a credential and do the work to get in - and rightly so as theyre very different areas of psychology with some things in common. And so I think Im a little on the sad side that you would prefer to work around the additional education - especially when the reverse wouldnt be an option for us. 

I think, and this is really my own thought not informed by others opinions, that you wouldnt be terribly well received in the IO space  clinical folks coming into IO without the same education is something that some find off-putting. 

That said I think if you were going to do this a strong quant background is important - and you really need to find some good solid education on some of our core skills like job analysis. 

Lastly  I think Id say be careful with the idea of painting yourself as an authority in IO, given your background in Clinical  you might have some similar skill sets, but theres a lot more to IO.",2

I absolutely hear you re needing further education. I guess Id heard that some clin psychs do go on to work in the IO space without another degree and I wanted to see how I could do the same.

As youre seeing in other comments, this is generally not a popular topic. Clinical Psychologists enjoy a number of privileges related to their status that for many if not most IO folks is out of reach. There are absolutely other clinical people doing these things, but I would say that doesnt mean its ok. They really are two different fields of psychology with a common label, Id almost say that it would be like trying to compare clinical psych with sociology&

It sounds like you have a lot of good aspirations, but do remember to find some balance in there, or the next three years are going to be rough! 

Research experience is good, and it will be very helpful - keep your grades up and do some GRE prep so your quantitative profile looks good on applications. I think your internship aspirations are also good, but I would recommend back-seating those to research and grades if youre definitely going to grad school. My guess (truly a guess) for grad school admissions is that theyre going to prioritize your quantitative indicators and research experience over any undergraduate internships. If youre able to juggle them all, go for it, but again, do remember to allow yourself some breathing room.

Internships could still be helpful, especially if you land something in HR. Could be tough, but start local. Does your college hire undergrads for work study in their HR department? Do you know someone in your home town who could help you get an HR internship? Imo, anything that gives you a little real world insight is valuable. Even if it doesn't help you in the application, it will give you some context in grad school. And I think internships *could* help you in the application - at the very least it shows that you are motivated in pursuing the field and faculty know these experience provide valuable context.

If none of those are attainable, then I think that being a research assistant in an I/O lab would be a good runner up.

The work experience can come from jobs or experiences that might not technically be an IO job, but allow you to apply principles of IO psychology or develop skills an IO psychologist needs. Its likely going to be hard to find a true IO Psych job or internship as an undergraduate because those will be going to graduate students.

The work experience I had in undergrad came from working in a research lab, which you already have lined up. A lot of skills I picked up in my undergrad research lab I still use in my job today. You can also think about how to apply IO psychology principles to other areas of your collegiate life. For instance, youre involved in Greek life. Im not very familiar with Greek life, but maybe theres an opportunity to interject some io principles to your fraternity or sorority. Create structured interviews with behaviorally anchored rating scales to select new members or select people for positions within the frat or sorority. Create a training program for new members. Similar things could be done for any part time college job. After you have some experience in the job, offer to help your manager with the training/hiring process.

You could also look to get an HR internship in the summer of 2024. As I noted, more traditional IO internships will be taken up by Graduate students but theres plenty of HR internships for undergraduates. Use your experiences in the research lab and Greek life to build up your resume to be more competitive for those internships.

With that being said, your top priorities should be your classes and your research lab. Dont get so bogged down in a job and extracurriculars that you cant maintain a solid GPA and a good relationship with the professor leading your research lab. Grad schools care most about your GPA, GRE, and letters of rec. If those are solid you can get into a really good grad program.

Finally, Id recommend possibly minoring in stats or even just taking some additional stats classes. In our field we are as much statisticians as we are psychologists. Related to that, build up your Excel and R skills. Some of that you might pick up in coursework but theres plenty of online resources to help with that too.",1

However, Psychology undergrad curricula have standardized to a great deal within the last 40 years due to the APA Guidelines and division-level efforts to improve the quality of psych training, so there are fewer differences between programs in terms of the kinds of courses that you will get. 

The BA/BS distinction is also increasingly dictated by the School/College in which the university's Psych Department is housed rather than the particulars of the Psych curriculum. Psych Departments that sit in Science Colleges alongside Bio, Chem, etc. are more likely to confer a BS than Psych Departments that sit in Humanities/""Liberal Arts"" Colleges.

What is enough pay to sustain your goals? What is the range of hours that you consider work-life balance? Is there a tradeoff between hours and WLB at all for you, and how much?


Client facing roles overall will have less predictability because you are beholden to someone else's demands in a more direct way. However, internal teams likely have a range of lifestyles depending on the culture of the organization. I can't imagine for example that Amazon's IO or people analytics team is going to be as good of a work life balance as the government people org/operations team might be.


I can't be very helpful as my role doesn't have the type of work life balance most people want (it's consulting). However, I would consider first moving within your industry or even your organization, if either has an organizational advisory/consulting team. It could be more energizing for you despite the worse work life balance, and then you can see if it's at all interesting for you without taking the full degree time off to reskill. There are even roles tangential to finance consulting, like in M&amp;A integration, that deal with culture and people elements.


So first define your needs/expectations, see if the field is compatible with them, and then create a path that is the most closely aligned with that through the switching period and beyond.",1

Sounds like shifting internally or finding a different kind of consulting role where you can build upon your experience could help until the market gets better.

For looking at numbers and not helping people, this could honestly go either way. An honest critique of our field is that our field would not exist without fitting into a prototypical business framework - e.g. does the company *really* care about employee engagement and well-being, or do they see that as a way to lessen cost by preventing turnover and getting more productivity out of people? We're often in positions where what's ""best"" for people isn't really - do you have any idea the amount of survey results I've analyzed where people are \*begging\* for cost-of-living increases and haven't had raises in years, or are being forced back to the office and all the comments are begging not to go back? I have to present to leadership and represent that somehow, but also understand that it's something they'll probably never concede on and so the conversation often centers around ""Other than those things, what can we do?"" I think you'd struggle to find any IO who hasn't been in this position. 

Naturally I think really ""making a difference"" really depends on the organization and industry. But you can't get away from the capitalist structure we've woven ourselves into and ultimately, why we're paid the salaries we are - because we benefit the business, not necessarily the people. Sometimes those goals overlap, but often they do not. This is something you need to be comfortable with. 

As for variable hours, this really depends on the job. External facing jobs will generally have worse work-life balance. Having done external consulting for a while, my hours were a lot like yours: months of 35-40 hour weeks followed by months of 60-70 hour weeks. I often told people I thought I averaged a 45 hour work week but my standard deviation was quite high. If you found yourself in the government sector or worked internally, particularly at large companies where you have more support and wear less hats, you may find yourself in a good W/L balance scenario.

That said, you don't get something for nothing. These jobs pay more because they demand more out of you - the chiller ones won't pay as much. I'll be honest with you: starting at $120/$130k is going to be really, really difficult with a Masters. I started around that in a VHCOL area but with a PhD, and my case was super atypical. Realistically even in a HCOL area with a Masters and no IO experience I'd have a hard time seeing you get more than $100k, possibly even $90k. 

To maximize earnings, tech or finance is the way to go, but those also tend to be more competitive and possibly concede on work-life balance. If what you want to do is maximize your earnings, I would really get good with your tech skills (be really good at stats, R, SQL, dashboards), get some consulting experience, and go into tech. If you can do people analytics but also be really good at influencing leaders and organizations through consulting skills, sky is the limit for pay.

So first, your  I-O psychology certainly gives you knowledge that makes you an effective manager if leveraged. That being said, most retail positions that tap into those areas, care less about degrees and more about experience. This means that the degree won't help directly. Instead, it will help you implement solutions and interventions that have a higher success rate meaning that you will be more likely to get promoted and placed there internally, or scouted and hired externally. 

This means, you need to start having candid conversations with your management about your goals and seeking out stretch assignments that show you have what it takes. 

If in consultancy, you can file an LLC and become an external vendor for problems you see. This may or may not help them promote you (it may be more ""cost effective) in their eyes to keep you as an external consultant...

However, I would argue that it is not true that humans are the ultimate black boxat least that humans are less so compared to AI-algorithms.Â 

The argument that we should outsource potentially bias-influenced decisions to slightly fairer algorithms rests on the outdated assumption that human behavior is universal, essential and resistant to change (although, to be fair, you do mention that americans to a larger extent show certain kinds of bias).

This is not the case; intergroup bias in humans can be understood and mitigated. As opposed to AI algorithms, human desicion makers have the ability to reflect on their own biases, discussing them and their consequences with their peers, allowing for intentional collective navigation towards ethical future states. When algorithms make desicions, it is nearly impossible to know why it decided as it did.Â 

This study (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2004.05.004) provides ""further evidence for the effectiveness of training in decreasing intergroup biases and for the potential influence of mental correction in moderating the effects of nonstereotypic training."" This study (https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12106) shows that the strategies with which judges conceptualize and act upon their own racial bias affects the degree of observed racial bias in their decision making. This study (https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764215580591) articulates how so-called ""colorblindness"" among white americans, for instance those who are involved in hiring processes, may result in subtle racial bias that may be mitigated or neutralized by adopting other mental strategies. Taken together, these studies show that relevant human biases can be alleviated or changed, and they are just the tip of the iceberg.Â 

It is thus clear that humans are not total black boxes and that change towards justice and fairness is feasible in the long run. It is possible for decision makers to aim for a fairer future, but this necessitates a continuous self-evaluation, and this self-evaluation is made way more difficult by the outsourcing of the decision making to the algorithms.

Algorithms tend to reproduce the biases with which they are fed. Humans also tend to do this, but in contrast with algorithms, we are able to self-reflect and steer our collective actions towards an imagined future. Yes, it is true that algorithms may also be continually tweaked and updated to be less biased, but this had to be done by humanswith all our human biasesin accordance with ethical considerations.Â 

And then you could say that humans can make these decisions alongside with the algorithms, but it might be the case that we trust the algorithms too much and trust ourselves too little, according to this study (https://doi.org/10.1093/jla/laab001). The comments on this post also point in this direction. What I want us to avoid is a future in which the decisions made by AI algorithms are naturalized and reified to the extent that they are seen as eternally truer than the human potential. It might be the case that we're already there.Â ",3_1_1_2

I'm a little bit confused when you say: ""Algorithms tend to reproduce the biases with which they are fed.

Yes, it is true that algorithms may also be continually tweaked and updated to be less biased, but this had to be done by humanswith all our human biasesin accordance with ethical considerations.""

Why, in the case of human evaluators, can human bias be mitigated with self-reflection but, in the case of constructing algorithms for evaluation, human bias cannot be mitigated with self-reflection? Maybe you could expand on this.

I think you underestimate how much control we can have over ML algorithm bias relative to human evaluator bias. For example, even though ML algorithms trained on human language data tend to adopt many human biases, we can assess how stereotypes engrained in language data influences how ML, for lack of a better word, understands language through word embeddings. We can then manipulate these word embeddings to mitigate the stereotypes that the algorithm would otherwise adopt. This paper demonstrates how this can be done to reduce gender bias in algorithms: [https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper\_files/paper/2016/file/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Paper.pdf](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Paper.pdf). Completely unbiased algorithms are probably impossible, but if I had to choose between trying to make a human evaluator or an AI evaluator as unbiased as possible, I would pick the AI evaluator every time because there are so many ways that we can mitigate bias compared to human evaluators.

Additionally, there are bias advantages that algorithms will inherently have over human evaluators. One example is intrarater reliability. Algorithms will invariably be more consistent than humans across evaluations. They aren't susceptible to fatigue or mood.

The last article you reference is interesting. However, the participants appear to be lay jury members who are not trained to use AI. An I-O psychologist who is trained to work with AI would likely interact and interpret AI suggestions/recommendations much differently than a lay person.

Even though I think there is a general lack of understanding of what AI is capable of, AI algorithms are not ""eternally true"" by any means and we should always remain skeptical of their capabilities.

Taking your question at face value, I think ethics is irrelevant to your question. If you use an AI to create an assessment at home and then do nothing with it... I don't think that's ethical or unethical.

To clarify why I think ethics is irrelevant here - let me ask a similar question for perspective? Do I think it's ethical to use a spoon to fill an 8 foot long, 2.5 foot hole? It's certainly inefficient, but who am I to say if it's the right or wrong way to go about getting the job done. I'm just trying to bury a body.

I think the real question being asked is the ethical considerations around automating things that really should involve a human element... I think that's wrong for sure.

I-O educational programs do not prepare students for what assessment development entails in the real world and I learned that first hand. It can take 12-18 months to create a relatively standard assessment and that timeline requires a small team of I-Os. Please dont forget that assessment development requires job analysis, blueprints, item development, item review, bias and sensitivity review, standard setting, form building, and form publishing. Most of those steps require subject matter experts in some capacity. 

Taken on the surface, AI generated item writing frees up time for staff and subject matter experts to better use their talents and is sure to increase efficiency in the assessment field. As mentioned, SMEs and experts will still be needed every step of the way. 


I think a more pertinent question to ask is what issues come along with AI generated items? First off, using publicly available large language models like ChatGPT for this purpose is a downright bad idea. How can you guarantee it did not draw the item from copyrighted material? How can you guarantee it didnt somehow stumble upon items from another similar assessment? How can you guarantee your items wont be used by ChatGPT when someone else asks a similar prompt when developing their own assessment. Basically, you cant. One way to circumvent some of these issues  is to build your own isolated LLM, but who has the capital to do that? And even then, are you sure your client or the area youre trying to assess has enough valid and appropriate source material to ingest in order to develop as many items as you need?

Having said that, what I would recommend is you start with *any* decent role in IO you can get and then find ways to incorporate data analysis into your role, even if it isn't a ""data"" role. For example, say you take an HR generalist role (or whatever lol) - while doing your normal duties, maybe you make some spreadsheets and simple graphs on Excel (or anything) that helps visualize something in your work, like the number of employees who are quitting each month, or how people respond to a survey - it doesn't matter *what* it is, the point is that you start to build familiarity with how to use data to answer questions and communicate insights to your manager or peers.

There's a lot of different directions you can take an I/O background depending on a few factors:




1. Do you want a phd or masters. Some of the really niche and highest earning potential jobs may want you to have a phd. Jobs in data science, assessment, or so things with research focus. At the masters level you'll find alot more applied opportunities where you take your knowledge and use it in the field at companies or consulting (though you'll find phds who consult too)Â Â 




Â 2. You'll need to commit to living in a handful of metro areas or speciality locations where I/O has a good presence. For private industry cities like NYC, SF, Chicago are good i/o hubs though they've become a bit saturated. If you're interested in government work, your only real option is DC or the surrounding area in Virigina or Maryland.Â Â Â 




Â 3. It's a great field but not a very stable one. We are a feast or famine speciality. In good economic conditions there are a lot of great opportunities for I/Os. Presently, we are Not in one of those periods and it likely to continue for the foreseeable future as the field has become fairly saturated with fewer entry level/mid levelÂ opportunities. At least with a phd you have an additional avenue to teach but you gotta want that lifestyle.Â Â 




Â Hope this doesn't come off as too negative cause it really is a great field with an amazing community of professionals but these are things I wish I knew going in though none of this would have stopped me from pursuing it",1

I will add that the most common government role I've seen for I/Os outside of the DMV is at the city level for exam developers. Basically, selection and assessment roles, but they tend to call you an exam/test developer or a higher level Human Resources assistant with an emphasis on examination. I've seen this in NYC, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and (according to a friend's new role) Hawaii. All in major cities still.

So, if you really want to dig in the weeds for these roles outside of the standard hubs, read those job titles carefully. You might need to tailor your resume to language that makes sense for them if they don't actively seek I/Os, as you will have the requisite skills.

You need to go to a master's program that has existing connections to industry due to its reputation for teaching you skills industry finds valuable   
and to a high standard.

Less rigorous master's programs, especially online programs, don't have industry connections because they do not teach valuable skills. If you go to a program without connections and without rigorous skill training, then 100% of the responsibility for finding a job lands on your shoulders, and you'll basically end up cold-calling places that have no interest in hiring you and who have already been recommended graduates from other programs. Even when connections aren't at play, you'll be applying to those jobs with fewer skills than those who did go to those programs who are also applying! You are essentially at a permanent disadvantage in the job market, and the gap between you and them will tend to get bigger over time.

You can still make that path work, but it's much, much harder. You are always playing catch up. A lot of people give up finding an IO job at that point and end up as a generalist HR worker, which is not an IO job and does not pay like one. Some people find ways to use the IO training they did get in that HR job. Some find a way to get themselves promoted into an IO job. Many (most?) do not.

Any time you see a post of the ""My GPA in college was a 2.0; how do I get into grad school next year?"" flavor, they are often launching themselves headfirst into this future. Desperation is the enemy of a meaningful career.

I'm currently studying abroad completing my masters in work and organisational psych (which is what Europe calls I/O psych). I go to Maastricht University in the south of The Netherlands.

The process was a bit of a mess as it's really hard to find information for an American wanting to study this track in the Netherlands. Basically, I identified schools that offered this program and applied to as many as I could. I started by checking the requirements and deadlines for each program and realized I'd have to take some supplementary statistics courses which I did while working full time.

The application process itself was extremely tedious as they require you as a non-eu member to fill in the details of every relevant course you took at your university in explicit detail. I hope you took a lot of psych courses or research methods courses because those are heavy requirements as well as statistics.

This process for me took about 8 months of planning and completing the two supplementary statistics courses I took online. Was it worth it? TBD as I'm still in the program. I've lived abroad for the last 7 years (not in NL) so this wasn't too new for me. But if you've never lived abroad it might be a bit more overwhelming moving somewhere new where you don't know anyone or how the country works.  However, I love it here and have made some amazing friends.

FAFSA still provides loans for masters programs even if they are abroad so that's what I'm using since this program is a full-time one year program only allowing me to work part-time.

essentially the idea is that companies and jobs are generally homogenizing forces and this happens through a few processes

attraction: similar people are attracted to similar roles
selection: the role requires certain attributes, selection systems should find those and filter out poor fits
transformation: people who make it in to a role change themselves in small ways over long periods of time as they exist within a conditioning system
manipulation: what people cant change about themselves they change about the role to create a system that is more rewarding for themselves
attrition: people who cant change themselves or the system to be rewarding leave the system

the TM part is a subcycle within the ASA cycle, with people repeatedly changing themselves and their environment to improve fit.

Many people have at least some opportunity to job craft, but some more than others. I am sure there is research that ties job crafting as positively impacting employee creativity. 

In organization, creative jobs tend to be more specialized and higher ranked. A unfortunate truth is that many employers don't encourage creativity from most of their employees. It's time intensive to consider the creative opinions of even the least capable and lowest ranked employees. Creativity is often, if not largely, encouraged more from high ranking members than low ranking ones. Being in a role where creative job craftjng s desired is a privlidge thats is not granted to everyone equally. 

That point asside, increasingly complex technology and work just means that high-skilled jobs involving more creativity are becoming more prevalent. But prevalent and accessible are not the same.

There are no easy answers. All industries, academic research included, are full of self-interested people. That is not a problem of specific industry but the human condition - we makes choices in our own self-interest. Even people who self-sacrifice do so because they believe their self-sacrifice will be better somehow (e.g., in the long run, for their soul) than the benefit of whatever they are sacrificing. Some people have no qualms about pushing others under their heel as long as their own goals are being met. These people are everywhere.

As to your specific situation, you're motivated by doing things that others have not done before, by combining areas that people have not previously combined. But when you do that, you 1) increase risk dramatically and 2) confuse other people who don't share your values. That is a challenge I know well - when I graduated in 2009, the most common feedback I got on journal submissions was ""the study of technology has no place in IO psychology."" That is obviously not how things have turned out these days, but that was not at all obvious at the time - and often quite depressing. I questioned many times pre-tenure if research was the right career path for me because of the constant resistance to my research ideas. I was also motivated to write blogs and a textbook because those things were personally interesting to me, all while facing a constant stream of negative feedback about those things being a waste of my time given the traditional academic reward system. And that was a fair criticism - I just didn't care.

The problem of coauthors has similar issues. When you are out on the edges of what is ""generally acceptable practice"", coauthors with similar passions are difficult to find. You are mostly going to end up with people who just want to ""pitch in"" because they find what you're doing vaguely interesting but don't share your vision. There is no real solution to that other than being willing to be the spearhead of whatever movement you want to create. But you need to know going in that you will need to cut through a lot of resistance to get there. If that's not something you think you'll be able to stomach, including the risk that your ideas never become accepted, then academia will be a rough path for your mental health.

One of the most frustrating things about academia is that it more closely resembles a creative field than you might expect. Ideas go viral, papers find success in peculiar ways, and it's just generally difficult to predict what people will care about. This lesson was made most salient to me when I heard Paul Sackett says that the papers he was most proud of, people did not tend to know, and the papers that did reach overwhelming levels of awareness and impact were not the ones he would have predicted. I've had a similar experience since then. Investing years into a project that you are not sure will matter to anyone is the core of the academic experience.

As a result, and like in many creative fields, the people who are successful in academia tend to 1) persevere even in the face of extreme adversity, 2) believe in their judgment unconditionally, and most importantly, 3) don't let external criticism define them. You don't need to be 100% of the way to this mindset to start in academia, but it's difficult to last through tenure if you don't get there. Otherwise the constant stream of negative feedback and criticism will simply tear you down.

Other notes - one, I suggest getting some hobbies you identify with. If academic research is *something you do* instead of *someone you are*, it makes things dramatically easier.

Two, business schools are generally *way* worse about all of this than psych departments are. So maybe consider psych too? I know the salaries in b-schools are attractive, but I wouldn't trade my soul for it. =	",1

I would add a note of caution though about psychology departments. Psychology salaries are not great. I am 18 years post PhD, work at an R1 and have been moderately successful in my research career (lots of citations, SIOP Fellow. awards etc) but I make less now than when I started my post-PhD career and drive an 18-year old Honda Civic. If it broke down I would be taking public transportation.  Things are also not likely to get much better. Many public universities are facing substantial financial challenges - hostile state governments in many states and the dreaded ""enrollment cliff' -- so there is no reason to expect salaries in psych departments to improve. Business schools tend to be somewhat self-funding because MBA students bring in a lot of money. So, I really hesitate to tell any student to aim for a psych department. Yes, there are a select few where salaries can be quite good but these are the exception.

They are also much more focused on gamesmanship in terms of publications and rankings. You're probably reading to them as too unfocused and too ""social science-y"" to be a good cultural fit. The days when I/Os could waltz into any b-school uncontested are long gone, contrary to the advice still dispensed by some senior I/O faculty. 

So:

1) Attend to your mental health first. Pre-tenure anywhere is stressful, and you need to be well enough to run that marathon.

2) figure out the institutional profile that interests you. How much time, money, and resources do you need for your program of research? You absolutely need to figure that out if you aren't sure. How much teaching can you handle, and are you comfortable working with a heavier load of undergrads? You aren't competing for research-focused roles if you haven't been publishing up to this point, so think about regional Master's institutions and liberal arts colleges instead, knowing that a larger share of your time will need to be spent in the classroom.

3).Apply to psych programs, knowing that you're probably trading a lot of salary for vibes that fit your values better. Obviously you can only do that if your means allow, so think seriously about costs and lifestyle.",2

I was actually asked that by several folks from my program. At this point I look at the people going bschool and ask myself why? The only real answer is money. If that is someones primary goal then go for it. It wasnt mine. Other than feeling a little jealous when I see other IOs go that route, I have no regrets at all. I love being in psych. I have wonderful relationships with my colleagues, my students, and the alumni of my program. 

Like you, I was not accepted by the folks in my program when I was in grad school. Some of those was because of my poorly developed and unrealistic expectations and some of it was not because of things in my control. It was definitely a set back. I was not able to produce as much research as I really wanted early in my career - that has changed slowly over the years but it has been a long slow process. Another set back in pubbing was my universities IRB - which is a whole different story.

However, the upshot of that is that I decided to develop a side consulting business since publishing wasnt going as well as I would have liked. That has served me quite well. I make money, it helps my students find internships/jobs, it completely changed how I look at research problems and is now feeding a growing push in my career to publish. 

Put one step in front of the other. Take time to see what you contributed to your negative outcomes and do things differently moving forward. Continue to develop a new set of relationships. Look for success where you can find it and in places where you have control. The further you get from grad school the less what happened there matters. IOP is a small enough field that people might know that you have some poor relationships with others but large enough that the impact of that knowledge is negligible.",3

The document is approved by the APA, so it is as ""official"" as the APA is. If an institution doesn't follow the Guidelines - or at least try to follow them - I would personally question whether they have any real connection to the field of IO psychology.

Having said that, the ""try to"" qualifier is important, as you should probably think of the Guidelines as somewhat aspirational rather than a mandate. For example, no programs at masters or PhD level to my knowledge have 24 individual courses on the 24 core topic areas of IO listed there. All programs have identified a relatively small number of areas of strength and focus their curriculum there. Good programs will also take steps to ensure you are at least *exposed* to the remainder of the topics, e.g., in one week of a survey course. But the specific balance differs greatly between programs.

The most obvious cases are quite obvious - if a master's program offers only 1 or 2 courses focused on IO content, and everything else is an elective or from other areas of general psych, it clearly does not align with the Guidelines. If a program does not offer statistics and research methods training, it clearly does not align with the Guidelines. If a program does not explicitly train you in professional skills, it clearly does not align with the Guidelines. I'd expect a graduate from any such program to have a difficult time finding employment.

As a side note, the Guidelines are due by APA for an update around 2025-2026. I expect them to change a fair bit from the current 2016 version. So also think of the area list as somewhat of a moving target. For example, I would not be surprised to see something a bit more data science oriented added to the ""general knowledge and skill domains"" list.",1

Just to add a bit more, I'd advise against heavily relying on SIOP's Guidelines while choosing your program. Currently, they seem a tad outdated, missing out on essential, emerging topics and skills. For instance, abilities in computer programming (like R, Python, SQL), machine learning, and data analytics are now indispensable, particularly for graduates wanting to work in applied settings. The growing agreement in the importance of these skills and topics is evident at SIOP conferences (an abundance of packed sessions on these topics), in their publications, and even in the machine learning competition they've been running for over four years.

My main point is that the Guidelines may not completely capture the newest, most relevant knowledge and curricular areas, especially if your interest lies in fields like people analytics, HR analytics, or AI. On a positive note, I do know that SIOP is in the process of updating these Guidelines. Even so, it's better to consider them as one of many factors in your decision-making process. 

A tip Id offer is to identify your top three areas of interest (like analytics, talent management, diversity, training &amp; development, job analysis &amp; design) and then focus on programs where a faculty member specializes in your chosen field.",2

I have a degree similar to a data science MS, but focused on analytics as data science MS programs were uncommon at the time I got my MS. I'm located in the northeastern US, so what I say is specific to my experience in this area, and I've never relocated for a job.

Even when looking at fully remote jobs, I'd say the job market for data scientists is enormously competitive. At this point in time, there are few positions open, and I'd say a masters is a minimum requirement for consideration. When I've looked over the past few years, at least on LinkedIn there was still generally a high applicant to position ratio. I was able to leverage my previous experience as a software engineer and my professional network to get started with this career transition, and then build up enough of a base of experience to have been cold recruited to my current position during the great resignation when there was a clamor over tech people. Yes, I do feel very lucky.

Data science positions vary greatly in the type of work they do. To simplify things, I divide it into two camps: people who are focused on building/maintaining predictive models, and people who are essentially statisticians that help with decision making and evaluation of efforts. Model-builders have far more jobs available and a clear career progression as either an IC or a manager. Statistician-types, of which I am, have a far more challenging path with unclear career progression.

Statistican-type data scientists generally struggle with being effective in organizations, as most orgs don't understand what to do with a *scientist*. (The speciality of people analytics appears to be one area where scientific skills could reasonably be expected to be valued, but I don't have firsthand experience with people analytics.) This kind of data scientist requires collaboration and support across their org to be effective: engineering, product, marketing, UX. This role needs to influence and persuade others, or to be more blunt, play politics, in order to be successful. You will need to learn how to present results in a way that don't offend others (think of how to say ""your marketing intervention was ineffective"") and long term success requires a psychologically healthy workplace where results like that don't lead to people getting blamed and punished. This role can be deeply rewarding as the decisions informed can be of high consequence. But it also struggles with either being unable to achieve the cross-org support to inform work, or to have its results completely ignored as the priors of decision-makers and/or the organization's incentives are too strong to be overridden with any amount of analysis. (And this is what has led me to an interest in IO psych!)

Either kind of data scientist needs to have a competent ability at programming and the practice of software engineering (version control, code review, perhaps agile development). Orgs don't want to have to babysit data scientists with an engineer. Most orgs do expect DS' code to be awful, and one thing that has been helpful to me in my career is that as a former software engineer my code reviews go a lot more smoothly, and I can interact more deeply with engineering teams in general. This increases the velocity of my work and the range of areas in which I can contribute, although it does lead to me sometimes feeling more like an engineer than a scientist. That does win trust through, and helps me to push for doing more than just descriptive statistics (pretty charts), which is another constant battle of statistician-type DS.

Mathematical skill is essential. My MS was a math-light program and that is one of my biggest criticisms of it. You might not be implementing algorithms from scratch, but you can't treat different models or statistical methods as black boxes. Unlike most programming work where a flaw leads to an overt bug, you can apply inappropriate methodology, get a result, but have created something that actually misinforms decisions. It's also important to be able to read the latest research and integrate it into the solutions your develop.

Regarding education, I'd say that DS master's programs vary widely in content. Pay close attention to the kinds of courses offered. To be effective, I'd say there should be a balance between stats, math, programming, and business. In the future we might find more specialization in job titles and duties, but most companies are at an immature point where they want DS that are generalists and specialists at the same time (deep in one or two areas, like NLP, CV, causal modeling, product analytics). Even though I work somewhere with numerous data scientists, I'd say we all have a similar base of skill across those areas. Critically, a lack of business understanding will result in your work failing to have any impact, and I think this is something that can be neglected in DS programs.

Overall, this post might sound negative, but what I want to convey is the deep challenge of a career in data science. What has enabled me to keep my sanity so far is that for whatever reason, *I just love performing deep analysis and having the opportunity to learn about and engage with many facets of the business*. My chief complaint is that there is a ton of dysfunction in how DS are used by orgs: this is a new career path and organizations are still learning how to make DS effective in their roles. The org you end up with might give up on tackling such a challenge, especially if they just hired DS because ""data is the new oil"" or ""we have to do AI"" or some other superficial understanding. It can be *enormously* demoralizing to be stuck in a position like that with seemingly no recourseI've been there, even had the advocacy of higher leadership, and just needed to accept that it was time to move on. And dealing with these challenges that I and my colleagues experience has led me to an interest in IO psych.

Hopefully this wall of text is helpful to you. And lastly I should mention that at least in tech, data scientists are generally very well compensated. It's easy to see that compensation, and maybe make a purely economic comparison to IO psych or some other career path, but that compensation comes with all the difficulties I've mentioned above.",2

I usually like to point out that it might be people don't like how those things are **commonly implemented in the field based on what they've experienced/heard about**, not that they dislike the topics themselves. 

There is a huge difference between ""interviewing applicants for roles by asking them 'why do you want to work here' every single time"", and ""interviewing applicants using a battery of validated assessments and techniques and determining how appropriate they are for the role"". Same with any other functions. People don't like ""training employees by reminding them to take the required annual webinars"", but they might feel differently if they get to apply the ADDIE model and genuinely track the professional growth of their workforce.

There are lots of options, even for someone with just a Master's. Currently, a Master's and PhD are interchangeable in terms of organizations staffing someone with a background in IO. It's a field with wide-ranging applications, and it's possible branch out into industries other than HR. It won't be easy, but then again, it's also not easy to get into HR with an advanced degree in IO either.

It's not unusual to go right into grad school after college, and many of us joined IO after working in other psych branches or even other industry in some cases. Primarily, you should just focus on adapting to grad life and doing well in your coursework at this point. Maybe visiting office hours as many times as you can, even just to put some face time in with the faculty and chat about what they're working on. And of course, just take in the campus whenever you can (if you're not attending virtually). There will be plenty of opportunities throughout the next couple of years for you to beef up the Applied side. 

But if you are compelled to go extracurricular, there are several options: Join a research lab. Find a faculty that's doing consulting on the side and offer to assist/intern. Depending on where you are and which local IO professional association is available, they sometimes have competitions where students have to generate practical solutions for a real-world case study, so join up with that team. If not, just be a member and attend talks and sessions when you can - meet your future colleagues and absorb how the field is currently operating. Go to the annual SIOP conference at least once if it's financially feasible.

They *are* allowed to just use cognitive ability tests, and some certainly do. Nothing prohibits this. There's obviously an argument for using selection strategies that are less likely to draw lawsuits, but any validated cognitive ability test is quite likely to be defensible in court. 

&gt;They have to demonstrate that they made the best possible effort to limit or eliminate adverse impact while predicting job success

An adverse impact case post-CRA 1991 unfolds in three phases. If the organization meets its burden at phase 2 to present compelling evidence of job relatedness, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff in phase 3 to identify an alternative process that meets the same business necessity (cost, validity, etc.) with less adverse impact. That's an *incredibly* difficult hurdle for the plaintiff to clear, and the blunt reality is that any organization that succeeds at phase 2 is overwhelmingly likely to win the case.",2_1_1_1

For example: many psychological tests do in fact screen out applicants that would have been able to thrive in their jobs with the right accomodation on the basis of measures of characteristics that are not relevant to that particular job. This violates the americans with disabilities act.

Here is a paper on that: [https://gould.usc.edu/students/journals/rlsj/issues/assets/docs/volume30/spring2021/Konopasky.pdf](https://gould.usc.edu/students/journals/rlsj/issues/assets/docs/volume30/spring2021/Konopasky.pdf)

I think that someif not mostof the anger regarding the unfairness of the use of psychological tests for hiring practices may be justified. What makes us (psychologists) so sure that what we're doing is fair, and that people who react negatively to our practices are simply perceiving the issue incorrectly?",8

The first -- which we do NOT talk about enough -- is what reasonable accommodation looks like in a selection process. All of these moves to automate selection, especially at the top of the funnel when we're dealing with a large volume of applicants, are usually at odds with individualized consideration. We still need actual people involved who have the training and authority to modify selection procedures so that we stay on the correct side of the law. A good friend of mine is legally blind, and it's shocking how many organizations are just befuddled by her reasonable request for alternative testing procedures. 

A second issue is about test validity. You write that ""many psychological tests do in fact screen out applicants that would have been able to thrive in their jobs with the right accommodation on the basis of measures of characteristics that are not relevant to that particular job."" That's entirely a question of the criterion-related validity evidence that test scores predict criteria of value for this job. Evidence of job relatedness means that the characteristics actually *are* relevant to the job, and you could defensibly exclude people who score poorly on the predictor. (Where you set the cutoff score and why is a whole other can of worms.)

A final issue is about face validity and fairness. To my first point, it's hard to offer reasonable accommodations if you aren't thoughtfully explaining how your selection process will unfold and what you're measuring; candidates obviously have to be informed before you can expect them to express their needs. You want to present your processes and outcomes with sensitivity, offer a reasonable chance to contest results, and generally embody as much procedural justice as you possibly can. The OP's score result, which is just bluntly saying that your IQ is too low for you to work here, does none of that. Even if your test has fantastic evidence of job relatedness, you're going to wind up unnecessarily defending yourself in court if your presentation sucks.",8_1

As an undergrad, I really appreciate that people with PhDs are willing to open the gates to the ivory tower sometimes.

I agree with all of your arguments, but I would still like to accentuate this point: you cannot defend a test on the basis of its adequate test validity and job relatedness if that test screens out applicants due to the inadequate provision of accommodation in the selection process. A test might be perfectly tailored to a job, but if some applicants are not provided the right accommodation and perform poorly as a consequence of this, leading to them being denied the opportunity to attain a job that they could thrive in with the right accommodation, then that would neither be fair, just or legal. 

Although a tests job relatedness and the provision of accommodations in the testing process can be tackled as separate issues, both issues are detrimental to the overall fairness of the outcomes that is produced by the test. 

I realize that the sentence that you quoted from my comment was poorly worded, and Im glad that you pointed it out. What I meant to say was more in line with what Ive outlined above: If proper accommodations were in place, the screened-out applicants could exhibit the desired job-related characteristics that they failed to exhibit due to poor accommodation. I argue that the fact that they are robbed of the opportunity to perform as they would in a properly accommodated job setting causes the testing process to be unfair regardless of the tests job relatedness.

Furthermore, we cannot ignore the issues pertaining to applicants having to disclose that they have a disability in order to be accommodated. I know its not legal to discriminate on the basis of this information, but it certainly happens. Im not sure how to get around this problem.

I attend this career coach's networking events in person these days to support her. But yeah, the LinkedIn thing is free, and a huge part of it. Also, updating the Skills section allows recruiters to find you. Basically, you are looking to get active LinkedIn users in your network, because they are the ones who share opportunities that will be relevant to you.

Meanwhile, people will have a full page of paid and unpaid work with consultancies, contractors, local organizations, etc., but they still do not feel good enough because they haven't gotten that break yet.

I found that to be much more challenging than I thought since the degree alone was not enough credibility. Most clients want experienced consultants if youre doing it independently.

Im sure there are many ways to go about this but these are the two that worked for me.

1. Part time freelancing in an adjacent field and prove your worth and credibility by being a strategic partner. Then your next project with that org could be more consulting based.
2. View your internal role as an internal consultant and use that pivot into a consulting firm.

You might find that youll have more time to consult on the side if youre main job is not already consulting, but its likely easier to consult on the side if your main job is consulting.",9_1_1

I taught my groups like this: 
 
MBTI is not meant to put people in a box. You can be any combination. Its just that one combination comes more naturally than others. 

We taught this two ways: have participants pair up and toss a ping pong ball back and forth. Then tell them to use their other arm. They can still do it, it just might seem awkward, but they can still do it. 

And over time, we may actually shift to what once felt awkward is now natural.

Source: former MBTI practitioner.

Edit: I totally dont get the response to what I said here. Especially being called a white supremacist. 

For example, 30 years ago, when I first took the MBTI, I was an ENTP. Fifteen years later, I was an INTJ. The last time I took it, I was an INFJ. 

Over these years, I changed careers, increased my life experiences, gained a lot of education, and wound up married, a parent, a grandparent, with a job that is very regulatory driven. Today, I am an ENFJ. And that can change.

Edit edit: I forgot mention the other way we talked about MBTI: you get in your car, drive and automatically have a natural position for where your hand(s) lands on the steering wheel. You can use your other hand, but its not your natural behavior.

Also, IO Psych helps develop personality indicators for HR selection. Seriously do not get the reaction here.  I dont necessarily agree with them.

I liked this part of your column, and it's something that I really struggle to discuss effectively with undergraduates. Doctoral education can't be made easy while preserving the qualities that make it worthwhile. (Granted, it probably could be made *easier* in an incremental sense if we paid attention to our own research on work/life balance...but it will never truly live comfortably alongside an already-packed schedule of life demands.) It can't be something that you do for six hours/week in online classes if you want to be competitive against residential students at top programs that expect effectively a full-time commitment. However, the investment that these predatory programs are making in perceived legitimacy is *really* hard to overcome; students are just hearing ""my opinion"" telling them things that they don't want to hear versus a glossy, professional sales pitch that looks convincing.

I think this is where we differ a little bit. College debt is too serious to be unsure where you will be able to find work. I think a psychology undergraduate degree should prepare you for job in the field. And if many of the jobs in the field require a graduate degree than the undergrad should tailor to that. It's a pretty pragmatic approach, but getting a job is hard and the more degrees can be highly focused to a career path, the easier time students will have finding work. What you describe sounds more like a general studies major, to me. Which I think would be a fantastic idea, general science studies or something similar where students get a cross-departmental education on the things you describe.",4_1_1

It doesn't matter to them what major someone has, or really, if they're capable of succeeding in college. If they come in with the ability to pay tuition (whether out of pocket or through loans that will track them for years, or decades), that's what a lot of administrators want.

Which leaves folks in psychology programs trying to explain that, no, you won't end up able to be a criminal profiler when you're done here, and no, even if you go get a doctorate in forensic psychology, you probably still won't end up as a criminal profiler, and no, if you decide that you only need a 3.0 to get into grad school and tank a few classes you won't actually be fine when it's time to apply for grad school because grade inflation is a real thing and meeting any hypothetical ""minimum cut-off"" for grad school won't make you competitive, but yes, if you actually work hard and learn the competencies that organizations want (learn to write well, learn to present well, be a good critical thinker and leader) you'll be successful -- but no, those aren't the things you're going to get if you keep picking classes based off ""easiness"" ratings on ratemyprofessors.com.

I don't know what you mean by ""predatory."" There certainly are predatory colleges and universities out there, like the for profit ones that aren't accredited. And I don't know which universities' curriculums and syllabi you reviewed to come to these conclusions. At my degree program, you have to enroll in a course to see the full course content.

However, I am currently an ABD in an online I/O program and have been very pleased with the education I have received. Even the frustrations I've had with my program, I've learned through talking to graduates of other, very prestigious, programs that their programs have the same weaknesses. For example, when I was at the APA last year, several presenters mentioned not having been taught python in their degree programs (I had been pretty ticked off with mine prior to hearing that). In fact, pretty much everything that my program lacked I have since learned that almost all PhD programs lack.

For anyone reading this who is young and unencumbered and free to move and attend a fully funded PhD program, you should certainly do that. It's always better to make money, even if it's not much money, than to just pay out tuition. But I have been amazed at the brilliance with which (almost all) of my classes were designed. I'll tell you a bit of my story for context:

1. I mastered out of a PhD program in Developmental at University of Georgia in Athens some decades ago. It was a funded program, but the classes weren't structured for maximum effectiveness. Almost every professor had his own agenda (one was fascinated with fractals, one was really mad at the way his grandchildren were being raised, one was me-searching his own impotence, one was obsessed with Tai Chi). There was porn all over the office walls, there were cartoons about the stupidity of women, there was no tolerance for people of faith, which I was. In short, I didn't learn a lot from my professors there. I took my MS and went back home. As an online student, I am TOTALLY free of any such drama. My classes cover topics relevant to the course objectives, not whatever the professors are mad about. 
2. I raised my children, which involved homeschooling them overseas. This took every ounce of energy I had for about 10 years or so.
3. Listening to podcasts and Ted Talks, I fell in love with the study of organizational behavior and, in an attempt to get access to empirical studies on the topic, ended up searching for a PhD program. My family was living in the UK at the time and the local university required ""academic references."" All my former academic references were dead or retired. I doubt they would have remembered me anyway. Tuition for someone with my visa status would have been about 70,000 pounds. In addition, I have mobility issues that would have made navigating a large college campus very difficult.
4. I researched online programs. Synchronous classes from the US would have met at 2:30 a.m. my time. I didn't feel like I could give my best attention under those conditions. I chose the least expensive option that was fully accredited (\~38,000 USD).
5. I've loved every minute of my studies in I/O.  I knew what ""PhD-level knowledge"" of a field looked like, and I knew that most PhD students of in-person AND online programs feel they haven't been taught enough. Knowing that being a PhD student meant taking responsibility and initiative for my own learning, I put on my big girl pants and got to work. I've spent four years pouring myself into acquiring that level of expertise. I used the extra time that I wasn't doing a TA or RA to satisfy my curiosity by reading more about the topics we were studying in class. I had coffee chats with professors, many of whom were practitioners. I joined several online I/O groups and societies. I combined my sociological studies, my developmental psych knowledge, and my overseas experience with my I/O interests to expand my knowledge of organizational behavior. I would not have been able to do this if I was just becoming a clone of my advisor.

I appreciate you desire to serve future students by improving in-person degree programs, but this column doesn't seem to put this forth as the main point. It seems (to me) the main point of this article is a resistance to change. I would like to suggest to you:

1. There's no going back. There are, and forevermore will be, online PhD programs.
2. This may mean a change in what ""a PhD"" means. If I had spent the past three years becoming a clone of my advisor, I would have published articles and presented posters. I may have been a better researcher (I'm starting my dissertation now, so the jury is still out on that one). As an online PhD grad, it's doubtful I will have the credentials for a tenure-track position in academia. BUT, I am FULLY confident that I have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to begin work as a top-notch (entry-level) practitioner of I/O.
3. It's natural to assume the best, or only, way to learn is the way we learned. We're seeing this now as boomer CEOs call everyone back to in-person office work. When I wanted to teach my kid computer programming, I looked for a book on Basic because that's what I learned in middle school (we ended up learning python, which I'd never heard of but he now uses all day every day).
4. Change can feel threatening, but it doesn't mean that there won't be a demand of in-person programs, at least for many years.

I hope you won't use your platform to marginalize those of us whose path looks different from yours. Our skills won't be identical to yours, but they are valid.

But I don't think you're actually responding to points Tara made in the article, since she operationalized ""predatory"" several times. One of her key points in describing such programs was this:

""Students do not take any doctoral-level coursework and instead take asynchronous online classes in huge cohorts with no research mentorship. A PhD is supposed to be a research degree, but these students graduate with no exposure to research at all.""

Would you describe your PhD experience as having zero research mentorship? You describe your advisor as actively publishing articles, presenting posters, etc. Clearly you talked with them about research? Even if you did not do those things yourself, you were exposed to the importance of well-designed research in making trustworthy conclusions through both classes and in your relationship with your advisor, right? You took research design and stats classes? Assuming yes, she implicitly declared your program ""not predatory"".

On top of that, I'm sure you read Tara's research articles in your training class(es) - she has published a ton on how to make online learning effective. So the idea that she is somehow arguing against online education in general is a particularly odd one to me.

And as a final note... it is debatable that knowing Python is particularly important for most IO roles. It is more likely that you will work on teams collaborating with people using Python who know it a lot better than you do, because they spent 90% of their time during their PhD actively coding in Python, whereas you spent that same amount of time studying IO.  It doesn't hurt, but it is certainly isn't a deal-killer, as long as you know either it or R (i.e., you need competence in statistical programming; the specific language is less important; frankly if you applied to a job saying ""I've coded ML algorithms in C++"", no one's going to ask ""but what about R and Python!!""). =",8_1

Apparently, I wasn't clear. To answer your questions:

!. Would you describe your PhD experience as having zero research mentorship? 

No, I would not (see my response to Tara below). We had assignments of designing fictitious studies and getting feedback. I'd be curious to get your take on that, as well. In our stats and design classes, evaluation of research was emphasized. Critical thinking was emphasized throughout the program and instructors and course designers were evaluated on it.

2. You describe your advisor as actively publishing articles, presenting posters, etc. 

There was no advisor. During the prospectus development course, we were to approach potential dissertation chairs asking if they were interested. So, for the final year of the program, I have a chair who will advise me extensively on the project. Those meetings are live, not asynchronous.

3. Clearly you talked with them about research? Even if you did not do those things yourself, you were exposed to the importance of well-designed research in making trustworthy conclusions through both classes and in your relationship with your advisor, right?

While it's not an entirely fair comparison (because it has been so long since my time in the PhD program at UGA), I would say I've done these things more in my current program than I ever did in my in-person program. My current coursework is much more focused on evaluating research than the in-person program was. Maybe the expectations of a program are different than they were back then?",8_1_1

There's a difference between ""apply scientific reasoning to understand and address a problem"", which is more PhD or even IO MS/MA program, versus ""let's talk about case studies and come up with solutions intuitively"", which is more like an MBA program. Personally I'd argue that gaining experience designing studies, actually running them, interpreting the results, and writing them up for (attempted) publication is a much better training experience than practicing research critique alone, but both are ""researchy"" for lack of a better word. :)

There are certainly PhD programs calling themselves IO programs that have much less research emphasis than what you've described here! I've heard several stories of ABD students needing to teach themselves what t-tests are and then running a dissertation that is basically a within subjects 20 person t-test, because that's the most advanced research design and analysis they are capable of doing given the training they've received. That's just a massive failure of the program, one that I certainly wouldn't call ""PhD level"", and that program failure is going to follow the graduate around for their entire career - *that's* the problem with predatory programs.

Even having said that, different PhD programs, even among the traditional ones, can have very different approaches to research skill related instruction. Some are more class-based, some are more practical, some are more applied. And frankly, some advisors are just very bad at it or don't care - I've heard many stories about PhD students (less so in IO, but they're still there) treated more like free labor than students developing research skills - that is why I recommend all PhD applicants have conversations with current grad students before picking a program and advisor. But the key to any of it being a ""PhD"" is still that research skills focus, whatever the specific path to get there. 

I definitely don't know enough about UGA's training model to speak to that experience specifically, but systematic failures in training are things that become obvious in the IO recruitment market over time. IO recruiters often administer work sample tests or simulations to measure the skills a graduate brings, and when 10 out of the last 10 people from a particular PhD program were completely incapable of completing the task successfully, that program begins to develop a bit of a reputation - and it is one that tends to persist, even if the training improves later, because this is a very small community.",8_1_1_1

I think you're a terrific example of how online education can be profoundly valuable and important for people. As Richard says below, I have no interest in claiming that online = bad. Studying for a PhD involves learning how to design, conduct, and evaluate research-- all skills that require actively doing the thing, not just reading about it. Of course the doing can happen online, but it does have to happen. Just like watching flight simulation videos won't qualify a person to fly a plane, or reading anatomy textbooks isn't enough to let someone perform surgery. We should treat our field with the same level of seriousness and respect.

I would argue that the most important skill a PhD has is in critically thinking about research. Python and the rest will come and go, but systems thinking is forever. And, that kind of skill is also unique to our field, whereas programmers are plentiful.

First of all, I owe you an apology. I didn't realize that online training was one of your research areas. So, you don't fall into the category of others that I've interacted with on this topic. 

In looking at my coursework in light of the 3 questions of (1) design, (2) conduct, and (3) evaluate, I would say that in my present online asynchronous program:

1. In many of our courses, we were asked to design a fictional study and present the proposal as a narrated powerpoint or research paper. This involved a lit review of at least 25 peer-reviewed articles within the past 3-5 years, a future-tense methods section, and potential limitations section. The assignment was graded and feedback was given. I would be interested to get your take on the effectiveness of this approach.
2. The last year of study is the dissertation itself. That's the only time ""conducting"" took place, at least for me. I'm just starting that now. I have a really good chair, so I expect my experience will be really beneficial.
3. Critical thinking was always an emphasis of every class. In a few classes, we wrote critical reviews of specific articles. Mostly, we were expected to evaluate the studies we read and our stats and design classes contained instruction on what to look for as we evaluated studies. 

While it's not entirely fair to evaluate my experience of UGA's psych PhD program so long ago, I got almost none of this from my time there. I was given an advisor when I began the program. Until I started my thesis, I had very little contact with him. It's not that he was a bad professor--he had won awards and edited a widely used textbook. Most of my opportunities outside of classes came from teaching assistantships. There was no research experience for me there, other than my thesis.

As for loving fractals, that's great. But it would have been nice to discuss the topic of the course, which was primate behavior. :)",8_2_1

""I'll never be able to use the degree I worked so hard for"" and if this applies, to avoid blaming yourself ""I was such a  \[adjective\] for not networking more.""  None of those thoughts are useful or helpful.   You could use the empirically sound technique of cognitive reframing to help you master your disappointment, name your feelings: Disappointment, Burnout, Sadness... Then, reframing your reactions. ""Even though I've been searching for months, I have the same skills I had when I graduated and I am still competent and capable."" 

Personally - for job searches, I find one of the most self-motivating things I can do is to keep a spreadsheet of my actions.  My columns include: Job title, Application, Date posted, Date Applied, Stage of interview I made it too, Why the job appealed to me, if I knew anyone there, Feedback I got from the interview, and my final reflections on it. It's motivating for me because one of the only things I can control is my actions and my mindset, and this is a good reflection of that.

The big problem is that I/O is in bed with capitalism.

Collectively, a lot of the work we do is tied to productivity and job performance, and you'll find that several applied studies will usually use some kind of predictor variable while having these or a similar construct as an outcome variable. This makes sense - if you're gonna do research for an organization and if they're gonna support you, they're gonna want something tangible (money) from it.

Individually, we have to pay our bills. I think this is one reason why people choose to be independent consultants in our field, as they can pick and choose the work that aligns with what they'd like to do. I don't know how successful people are who choose to adhere to only partaking in work that helps others, but someone might be able to weigh in. But the rest of us will do whatever it takes to stay on payroll.

Although we can talk about all kinds of employees, I think those on the frontlines - retail, food service, customer service, anything that the media likes to call ""unskilled labor"" - are going to be the key to solving this. They're already striking and putting their foot down on what they'll take. Most I/O research will conclude that these people need to be compensated better and treated humanely, but it's meaningless when employers don't give a damn anyway.

I think I/O is going to have a long way to go. We're already in a general identity crisis because so many other disciplines overlap with us, and our history dates back to supporting the military and dominant power structures. Even if we know that all employees deserve to be treated better and that better compensation and work-life balance are great for us, we also need to acknowledge I/O psych's complicity in this system.

I think the best we can do right now, which is already being done, is to start listening to these people and tailor our efforts to support others in their missions. It's just- well, good luck in the fight against shareholders. We probably need a nice revamping to get there.",1_3_1

It is unfortunate that scales like the MBTI are so much more popular than psychometrically validated personality scales (most of the top psychology subs are MBTI communities). Is this an issue with how we are marketing our psychometric work? Do people not care about actually measuring constructs of interest? Do executives not actually care about predicting employee behavior? Given the experience you mentioned discussing face validity with students, do you have suggestions for how we can get people to be concerned with the more legitimate forms of validity?",2_2_2_1

In the last company I worked for, my police assessment got criticized and then thrown out because the pilot candidates I tested said that their cops would find it too difficult.

Mind you, I based this exam on their policies and their local and state laws. But anyway, not only was my test made so easy that the item discrimination was too poor to be of any use, but they got rid of the minimum score requirement I advised and also made it open source just so that the cops could participate in the live portions of the assessment center. So even if I had reused the test for future work, it was always going to be a terribly written, poor excuse of an assessment tool. Something like 40% of the questions had an item discrimination of 0 and everyone (just shy of two dozen if I recall correctly) got the question right.

These cops have guns, of course. I had a similar but less extreme example from another police department that was in the news for brutality last year, when that prior year I suggested measuring more soft skills and they refused.

Even though it wasn't me personally who made those calls, I still contributed in a way to that. And it felt awful. I feel like stuff like this happens a lot due to many I/O's being long-established in their fields and participating in nepotism (let's call it for what it is) both during the hiring process and how they handle problems during the day-to-day.

I got my masters the end of 2021 and started work immediately. I had a weird start in that I had a job offer from the Secret Service with a start date and all. Then a week before I started, it got rescinded. Nothing to do with me. 

My family had moved away the week prior, so I was in the city without a job for months, and I still had one more semester left. They moved to a place where theres no such thing as I/O, and I didnt want to kill my career before it started. 

That meant I had to turn everything up into overtime - leaning into I/O work, networking, learning all kinds of skills, job hunting, all of it. It sucked, as by the time I got my first offer, I had lost 95% of my savings. 

Im just now stabilizing, as I had a pretty awful first I/O job experience as you can see and was considering leaving the city.

1. Conceptualization: some researchers have conceptualized LMX in terms of followers' perceptions of their relationship with their leader (i.e., individual level), while other researchers have focused on the quality of the relationship that supervisors and followers share (i.e., dyadic level). As Gottfredson et al. (2020) aptly noted, what makes these perspectives problematic is that through all of the different theoretical associations, one can cite different branches of LMX research to support either level of analysis, all while using the same LMX measures (p. 11). 
2. Definition: LMX has been defined in a variety of ways. Broadly speaking, LMX has been defined in terms of (a) how leaders develop different relationships with their followers, (b) how leaders exchange different resources with their followers, (c) the quality of a relationship between a leader and their followers (sometimes from the point of view of the leader, and sometimes from the point of view of the follower), and (d) the quality of the exchange between a leader and their followers. Thus, scholars have sometimes defined LMX in terms of relationship, sometimes in terms of exchange, and sometimes in terms of both relationship and exchange. Since its inception, the construct has been ill-defined.
3. Measurement: there exist several scales to measure LMX. However, those scales (1) were not developed with a clear, a priori definition, (2) do not assess exchanges, although they are often discussed as central to LMX, (3) lack evidence for divergent validity with regard to other leadership constructs, and (4) are most of the time measured at the individual level, although LMX is, by definition, a dyadic concept.

In sum, there is much confusion about what LMX is and how to best measure it. Ultimately, this biases the conclusions that LMX scholars draw from their studies. This is also concerning for practitioners and policy makers as the ""evidence-based"" advice that they are given is based on flawed arguments. 

These issues have been extensively discussed by Gottfredson et al. (2020) in a paper published in Leadership Quarterly - this is one of my favorite papers, I highly recommend it. The authors are quite harsh (sometimes borderline aggressive) and literally destroy the whole field, by they make some excellent points. They conclude their paper by noting the following: ""Collectively, these issues lead us to conclude that LMX is not a valid construct and therefore incapable of serving the needs of the theories it has traditionally served, and as currently constituted, unlikely to advance leadership theory and practice in significant or meaningful ways. We are left to conclude that there is little value for its continued use"" (p. 11).",5_2_1

I sometimes have the feeling that leadership research is more concerned about marketing than producing high-quality research. Don't get me wrong, I firmly believe that studying leadership is important, but some leadership concepts suffer from serious flaws.

Specifically, the problem is that leadership is most of the time defined by its consequences. For instance, Bass and Riggio (2007) argued that transformational leaders are those leaders who stimulate and inspire followers to achieve both extraordinary outcomes and, in the process, develop their own leadership capacity \[emphasis added\] (p. 7). Similarly, Avolio et al. (2009) stated that authentic leaders display a higher level of self-awareness, which reinforces higher moral and ethical conduct in others. Such definitions are inherently problematic because they do not tell us much about the nature of the construct and what it means, making it difficult to distinguish the construct from its effects. Additionally, it feels that the different subdimensions of most leadership styles are randomly put together to produce a compelling and easy-to-sell construct. Consider for example the subdimensions of authentic leadership, which include self-awareness, relational transparency, balanced processing, and internalized moral perspective (Gardner et al., 2011). One could wonder what these subdimensions have in common and whether they really hang together. This confusion also begs the question of whether leaders who are high in self-awareness but low in internalized moral perspective can be considered as authentic. Unfortunately, these questions have been neglected by leadership researchers.  
Regarding the operationalization of leadership, studies typically involve employees reporting the behaviors of their supervisor or manager. This is problematic because it implicitly assumes that all supervisors or managers are leaders, which is often not the case in practice.",5_3_2
https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1b4v089/io_hot_takes/,xplaii,2024-03-03,1709479428,3,3,0,0,"So, a couple of things here. First off, good insight here on being able to identify the gaps and begin questioning. This makes a good researcher. Higher education is about being able to identify these gaps in research and fill them with new interesting research to address these problems or inconsistencies. Keep that up.

Effective leadership should include consequences, or outcomes. In general, leadership is about how it can influence employees and persuade them/inspire to produce. This is why toxic leaders (Hitler) and paradigm shift leaders (Lincoln) can both be effective despite having different reputations. That's accurate.

So, the different leadership constructs are all missing something, and this ties into your end note of you stating supervisors or managers are not leaders. They are all part of a leadership model within their context and their environment, which is a lot of what leadership tries to grasp through situational leadership models and LMX or transactional leadership, which all have their dark sides.

Here is my take: In general, leadership is leader-centric. We overplace focus on the leader and their individual KSA's versus the entire PROCESS of leadership, which includes the leader, follower, and environment within it. I think leadership models often don't distinguish between these things which is why you can have things like, ""self awareness or conscientiousness"" in conjunction with ""ability to inspire."" Both are true but one is focused on the Abilities, while the other is focusing on the skills and knowledge (or past experiences). These aren't always separated or acknowledged.

You can read David Day on this topic, his work really separates the different concepts between a leader and leaderSHIP, which are often bundled together to create a whole set of conflating issues.

Many of us in the field have a superiority complex relative to other social sciences (especially other fields that study work, economics notwithstanding) and an inferiority complex with the hard sciences and business.

We turn our noses up at more politically-oriented but equally objective takes on work, beat ourselves up for not understanding workers as precisely as engineers understand machines, and only ever think about how we can adopt business sensibilities to close the science-practice gap instead of about how business (or just collective human activity generally) can be more science-like and less ravenously profit-driven. Good science (not to mention prosocial behavior) and profit dont mix and we need to accept it if we want to move forward.

Speaking of moving forward, it seems like many in I/O(rightfully) complain that our field is stagnant and not innovating as much as it could. I think its because the capitalists have basically won.

&gt; Why do you think good science and profit dont mix? It isnt clear to me that this is true.

So it's more that the near-exclusive emphasis placed on profit, and thus the completeness with which we orient our field around that goal, turns us from objective scientists into political pawns. Which is fine and to a great extent unavoidable, but many of us refuse to acknowledge it, let alone work to find alternatives to it, which to me is a problem.

(Statist) politics and business really are no different fundamentally. They're both methods for consolidating power over others into the hands of a relatively small group of people. We're not helping businesses win elections because there are no elections to win (unless we're talking about union elections, which we have helped businesses to win), but we are helping them to exert more seamless control over their human resourcesthe place from which they ultimately draw their power. I know we don't see it this way in I/O, but it doesn't really matter. Functionally that is what we are doing. A business that doesn't have a compliant and predictable workforce is a bad business, and if there's one thing I/Os will not stand for, it is bad business.

Now, because science is a tool and not an ideology, it's perfectly legitimate and possible to use it to further profit-oriented goals. But to have a scientific field where this is functionally the *only* goal greatly stunts the development and applicability of the science. Most scientific fields, not just I/O, are in such a position because poor and working-class people don't have the resources to become scientists, let alone to fund big research grants and endowed professorships. As a result, many of us in this field are damn near incapable of understanding work through a lens that most people would find useful and beneficial to their own lives if they don't view ""being a better resource for my employer"" as useful and beneficial to their own lives. 

Even for those of us who can access alternative lenses, the tools and methods of our science as they stand now are not well suited to their application. There are so many possible angles that could be taken to making work better, and we have pigeonholed ourselves into the few that management and executives will give the ""ok"" for.

The above applies much more to academics than practitioners, obviously, but in most ways practitioners are even more boxed in than academics. There's far less room for questioning fundamental assumptions.

&gt; I also dont understand what you mean in the last paragraph where you claim that capitalists have halted innovation in our field and you mention AI. I-Os are especially useful in helping capitalists to effectively integrate AI into their workforce to improve organizational outcomes. Why would they not want that?

I think you kind of missed my point. Capitalists *do* want AI. They want it for the same reason they want I/Os in general: they want predictable sources of wealth generation. I/Os' jobs are to make the workforce more predictable and thus more ""efficient"" to harness for profit-driven purposes. Functionally, at least in the best case scenario (i.e., one where a business owner is not power tripping due to a lifetime of being too powerful to have anyone tell them to shut up when they really need to hear it), all a business owner cares about is predictable sources of adequate revenue. No new innovation happens in the world of business (and thus, perhaps the world itself) that does not have some version of this ultimate goal in mind.

That is a really, really narrow conception of innovation. It massively shapes the development of science and technologyand not in helpful ways, at least not in my opinion. Critical management scholars Mats Alvesson and AndrÃ© Spicer might refer to this situation as ""[functional stupidity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01072.x?casa_token=PDU9qjf5kyQAAAAA:Co_moyP9wsbmwDfU5ARU3-ZzCnwrBVuzem-ij18FW7iBafUGiRKSRUyiongshrjq8hJ6tTIZPl_QGw).""

We have innovation, but it's a fraction of what it could be and it only serves to reinforce power structures. And this isn't even getting into how maintaining such power structures is a horribly inefficient way to satisfy human need, which should, in my mind, be the ultimate point of any science.",10_1_1

Eh, I think this varies a lot by sub-topic. There's interesting stuff and boring AF stuff in all areas.

&gt;You do not and should not need a psychology degree to go into an I/O graduate program

So in premise I agree with this, and actually I think this is theoretically the case for a lot of programs but a little challenging in practice. You don't *need* the psych degree but you do need *something* that indicates that you have some underlying skills (e.g., methodological) and that you speak the same language as other I/Os. If you've worked on interdisciplinary teams, you probably have noticed that it sometimes seems like we come from totally different worlds and approach problems from very different perspectives. I've worked with folks in other areas, for example, who lack an understanding of how to formulate hypotheses or think about variables the same way we would. This can be valuable but it's also very difficult.

But my biggest concern for students (at least at PhD level) is that it's very important to me that a student has some idea of what they're getting into. If they come from a totally different field, I'm going to be less confident of that. Basically, if they don't have a psych degree, they will need to still demonstrate some knowledge of research methods, psych or business-related stuff, and a strong interest in I/O. Hence, *theoretically* I agree with you, but *practically* they still need to have some background because it's difficult to demonstrate that they're qualified without it.

Totally agree on everything else.

I'm glad I/O got a big look at WFH stuff as that was clearly needed with the pandemic, but as I said elsewhere in this topic, I don't think there's enough focus on the most vulnerable employees out there. Too much focus on WEIRD research reinforces the idea of who we find ""important"" and who's ""expendable"", even if the researcher is a poor person who'd fall into the latter category.

&gt;You do not and should not need a psychology degree to go into an I/O graduate program

My undergrad was in sociology. I had some psych credits and had taken research methods and analysis. I still couldn't apply to a renowned I/O school I'm local to because I was short by 3 psych credits where they specifically wanted me to take psych research methods, so I ended up going to a different school. 

What helped me was having real work experience. By the time I applied to grad school, I had been in the workforce for about 14 years, so I knew what I wanted to do. Fortunately, after taking the GRE and getting the letters of recommendation, and after taking a community college psych course to fill a tiny gap, I got in.

What's sad is that I think it's the students with the psych background already but no work experience who are struggling in the job market the most right now.",13_2

I view preregistrations as a half-assed tool that sits between a registered report and a lab notebook. Are there some good components to them? Sure, but I do not think they do enough to address/solve the problems they purport to solve. This ultimately results in a lot of wasted effort, time, and resources. I think if a researcher or research team is going to spend so much time writing up a pre-registration, they may as well turn it into a registered report and submit it to a journal for reviewer feedback/critique on the a) the research question being posed (i.e. Is it a well-motivated question? Is the question ill-posed or well-defined?, etc.) and b) the research design being used to answer that question (Is the estimand well-defined? Does the design map onto the estimand of interest?).

Almost two years ago, a famous study about a clever way to prompt honest behavior was retracted due to an ironic revelation: It relied on fraudulent data. But The Chronicle has learned of yet another twist in the story.

According to one of the authors, Harvard University found that the study contained even more fraudulent data than previously revealed and its now asking the journal to note this new information. The finding is part of an investigation into a series of papers that Harvard has been conducting for more than a year, the author said.

Details about the reported fabrications are unclear. Francesca Gino, a world-renowned Harvard Business School professor who studies dishonesty, and is a co-author on the disputed study, is now on administrative leave, according to her faculty page. Gino did not return a request for comment.

The head-spinning saga began in 2012, when a team of five researchers claimed that three experiments theyd done separately, and combined into one paper, showed that when people signed an honesty pledge at the beginning of a form, versus the end, they were less likely to cheat on the form. This intuitive-sounding conclusion turned heads at government agencies and companies.

But by 2020, it was falling apart. The researchers, plus two others, reported in a new paper that they were unable to replicate the effect after running essentially larger versions of experiments Nos. 1 and 2, which involved university students and employees filling out tax forms in a lab. Max H. Bazerman, a Harvard Business School professor, has said that the two experiments were written up by him, Gino, and Lisa Shu, then of Northwestern University.

Scientific findings often fail to replicate for all kinds of reasons, not necessarily because they were fabricated. But in the summer of 2021, a trio of data detectives wrote on their blog that a close examination pointed to fraud in experiment No. 3, which, unlike the others, was based on auto-insurance customer data.

That experiment had been handled by two other authors: Nina Mazar, formerly of the University of Toronto, and Dan Ariely, a Duke University professor. The source of that fraud remains unclear. In 2021, Ariely told BuzzFeed News that he was the only author in touch with the insurance company that provided the data, but he denied fabricating it. At the same time, he gave conflicting answers about the origins of the data file that was the basis for the analysis. BuzzFeed News reported that the insurer was The Hartford, which confirmed doing a small project with Ariely but was unable to locate any data resulting from it.

It was yet another blow to the field of behavioral economics  which in the 2000s and 2010s churned out headline-grabbing strategies to subtly influence peoples behavior for the better, and has since walked back many of them. In September 2021, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences retracted the 2012 paper. But that, it turned out, was not quite the end.

The alleged new problems involve experiment No. 1  one of the two conducted in a lab with students. Bazerman told The Chronicle that on Tuesday, Harvard informed him that it believed fabricated data for this experiment made it invalid. According to Bazerman, Harvard provided a 14-page document with what he described as compelling evidence of data alterations. Their analysis found that somebody had accessed a database and added and altered data in the file, he said. I did not have anything to do with the fabrication, he told The Chronicle.

According to Bazerman, Harvard is recommending to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that it update the studys retraction notice to reflect its new concerns. (A journal spokesperson said, We are looking into the matter. A Harvard spokesperson declined to comment.)

Bazerman declined to discuss his co-authors. But in his book Complicit: How We Enable the Unethical and How to Stop, published in November, the Harvard professor reflected on the debacle of the 2012 study. How was it, he mused, that experiments Nos. 1 and 2 had both ended up being irreproducible?

In retrospect, Gino reported that her lab manager at her prior university managed data collection for the two laboratory experiments in the 2012 paper, Bazerman wrote in a chapter about the risks of putting trust in relationships. Thus, none of the authors, including me, provided sufficient supervision of these experiments. In addition, as I review emails from 2011 containing the dialogue between coauthors of the 2012 paper, I see concerns raised about the methods. I failed to actively engage and deferred to the decisions of my colleagues, and that failure makes me complicit.

He added, The irony of this being a story about data fraud in a paper on inducing honesty is not lost on me.

Bazerman told The Chronicle that his understanding is that the 2012 paper is one of four papers of significant concern to Harvard. He declined to identify the other three, but said he was not a co-author on them.

Gino joined the Harvard Business School faculty in 2010 after stints at the University of North Carolina and Carnegie Mellon University. She shot to academic stardom with her prolific, buzzy research on decision-making, leadership, and workplace behavior  including dishonesty and unethical behavior.

Her expertise has made her in demand as a consultant and speaker to some of the worlds biggest companies and institutions  Bacardi, Google, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Disney, Goldman Sachs, Honeywell, Novartis, Procter &amp; Gamble, and the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy  and as a source to media outlets from The New York Times to The Wall Street Journal, according to her website. She has co-authored more than 135 academic articles and written books including 2018s Rebel Talent: Why It Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life. Shes also been named one of the worlds 40 best business-school professors under 40 and 50 most influential management thinkers.

And as of recently, her role at Harvard is unclear. Within the last month, her faculty website was updated to say that she is on administrative leave, according to screenshots captured by the Wayback Machine. The Harvard spokesperson declined to comment on Ginos status.

I'll operate under the assumption you're asking in good faith:

I've hired and rejected many people in my day, and for many roles, especially people-facing and team-based ones, it does come down to non-quantifiables like how well you mesh with the hiring manager or how similar you were to the previous occupant. Similarly, it does come down to what personality traits the hiring manager doesn't want to see in candidates, and since most interviews don't come with expensive personality assessments, this means you might be rejected for a single sentence or joke gone wrong.

When I talk to hiring managers, sometimes it really is just ""They were a spectacular candidate who checks all of our boxes, but we're saying no because of this specific thing they said.""

I don't know a thing about you other than what you wrote in your opening post + the four comments you've left so far, but I can say with certainty that if you said anything remotely similar to what you wrote in the opening post, you'd be rejected by every hiring manager I've ever worked with. By virtue of being on a Subreddit like this, I'm sure you have the sense not to refer to somebody as a clown during an interview, but calling them clowns after the fact does bring into question how you presented yourself to the hiring manager.

It's entirely possible that you were an all-star candidate but the other person was just slightly better. Maybe you did absolutely nothing wrong and wowed the hiring manager with all the right KSAs and a stellar personality. Again, I don't know you, the position you applied for, or anything about this situation other than what you wrote here: that you were rejected from a position and that you believe your interviewers to be biased clowns. That doesn't inspire confidence in your personality fit for, well, most people-facing roles.

I got rejected from what would have been around a 75% salary increase and fully remote role, away from a truly horrendous company, after three interviews. It was in selection, specifically promotions which apparently is my niche now.

The hiring manager loved me, and the technical folks said I knew what I was talking about, but the final interview was with a manager I would not have been working with. 

The feedback I received was that I was too focused on psychometrics and not on people. She thought that my insistence on focusing on job performance and on any relevant assessments meant that I would ignore someone who cried for a role that they felt they deserved. 

Which was insane, because 1) this actually did happen at a job I was at ten years prior to that interview, resulting in me being passed for promotion, 2) they had revealed that the previous promotions manager was incredibly frustrated with their process, 3) I actually think I am very soft, so I specifically try to use data to remain objective, and 4) it was just a very weird way to say I didnt fit in culturally.

I was devastated because I really hated my previous I/O role and wanted to leave, but now I realize that I probably would have gone insane in that role and I really just wanted to escape my shitty situation.

When youre unemployed and have little to no financial support, it really does feel like youre in a void. So getting close and denied at the end will sting and feel very personal. I say keep your interview story in mind when you are in a better place so you can remember how far youve come along.

Firstly, this is great news! I actually started learning R with your freely available course. It's structured really well and I had a great time learning with it.

dont learn r. learn python. python is the industry standard for ds. yes there are some niche analyses not supported in python, they are few and far between and often have easy to implement ways to run them anyway. for that small tradeoff you get to integrate into a much broader ecosystem, have easier paths to production, and the language doesnt encourage as many bad habits as r.

R guidance tends to be anti for loop to a fault, vectorized operations are great but for loops have their place.

R also tends to be anti user defined functions, and make creating personal packages overly difficult. package structure tends to be a mess with a different script for every function and no real order

R encourages abuse of the global namespace, whereas python encourages classes to hold variables to keep things clean and prevent accidental overwriting of variables. packages are almost always all dumped into the global namespace library x. if you were to do this in python from x import * anybody who knows anything would tell you thats almost always a really bad idea

documenting functions in R is so difficult most people literally use third party packages (roxygen2) just to document functions, or worse just comment in the docs, or even worse just dont doc at all

finally, probably my least popular opinion. R is dominated by hadley wickham dogma. the guy has some smart ideas but the cult of wickham is real, to the point that suggesting any plotting other than ggplot is sacrilege and using base R data manipulation is for heathens. this limits the beauty of R, diversity and competition amongst methodology driving cool new solutions",10_1_1

I suspect your reaction is pretty typical. Flexibility and freedom is what leads people to academic careers. In industry, you only get that by starting your own business or at the end of 20+ years of rank climbing (or fewer if you actively work the system). Government has its own unique set of issues. 

It's difficult for students to predict how they will feel later. A lot of them find the autonomy of grad school stressful, especially the risk of making decisions and failing, and they generalize that as an expression of their long-term preferences. Many also see working in academia as ""more school"" rather than ""a job"" which makes the waters muddy. I mean, I chose academia, but I still had to correct my brain for several years every time I though ""going to school"" instead of ""going to work."" 

I've certainly had students tell me they think they'll be happier with the predictability and well-defined boundaries of specific industry careers. Some of them were right. But others, often around 5-10 years into their careers, have felt like they're in a rut and craving more of a challenge/increase in purpose without an obvious way to get there.

The literature and courses to consider these questions has absolutely exploded over the last 10 years and both [Yale](https://goodlifecenteratyale.com/) and [Berkeley](https://www.greatergood.berkeley.edu/) offer a lot of resources on these respective sites.

Or, you could consider the aphorism ""a change is as good as a rest.""  And explore other I/O opportunities - find something that gives you a challenge in a different way.   A change to another thing doesn't have to mean lower pay even, as many business jobs which, IMO, I think are much easier than some I/O work, use nearly all the same skillsets.  If you are 6 months in and hate it, why not go back?

I assume people at conferences for a thing are pretty much there to talk about the thing the conference is about, and that in their spare time they are enjoying other hobbies (e.g. hiking, or sports or social media scrolling) and simply don't talk about it as much at conferences as they can talk about those things other times.",9

To get experience I've seen people do volunteer work, e.g., for a nonprofit. A few hours time can get another line on the resume. I've seen people give talks, e.g., at a local SHRM group to network. Look for any opportunity to get yourself in front of people who might help you with a job or even a small consulting gig. Use LinkedIn to build your network. Write blog posts there to get some attention.

Look beyond HR. Some organizations have training departments and other relevant functions outside of HR. Think of your broad skill set and look for jobs that you can do. I have seen IOs work as program evaluators in the mental health industry. Some do human factors work. Most focus on supporting human performance through selection and/or training, but there is the occupational health/safety/well-being and quality of life side too. IO skills fit all of these things.

I would also spell out Industrial-Organizational Psychology. Very minor and shouldnt matter in theory, but the person scanning resumes, again, might have been told to find students with a matching major to that.

This is just me and maybe others would disagree - would also place your technical skills above your work experience. A lot of these internships will say they want you to do a specific thing or things. Being able to change keywords near the top of the page will do you better. This I swear by as I had a similar problem years ago and got way more hits after doing this, but this is just an anecdote.

Finally, this might be even less popular and sound preposterous - but youre almost done with your degree. Try full-time positions. You can time the start date for after you graduate if you want.

Take your GPA out - no one cares. If they want it theyll ask for it.

Consider changing your resume to match specific language used in the postings. If firms are big enough they use automated systems to filter applicants with key words. So you dont want to lie (obviously), but if you can match their words to your resume it should help.

You need to demonstrate the impact you had. Very few of your bullet points show me what the outcome of your action/task was. Use some IO terminology and KPIs to demonstrate how you make an impact. Ex: ""Completed a qualitative-based job analysis on 10 employees, identifying key skills and experience gaps, which optimized recruiting time-to-hire by 50% and saved the company $100k in yearly wage budget."" 90% of them need to sound like this.

A smart thing to do with the KPIs/prior job duties, which aren't aligned to what you are aiming for, is to write only on what relates to your desired field. For example I also worked in a restaurant but I only have 3 bullet points that speak directly to being a Health&amp;Safety leader -  not one mention about my duties of being a server. as H&amp;S is a lot closer to L&amp;D (my desired field) than bussing tables.

You can also modify your job titles slightly. Recruiters are not going to do the work for you, so you need to help them out by putting ""Server + OHS Leader"". Otherwise without relevant previous titles, you will be skipped, especially in this current job market. Of course, do not lie, but make sure it reflects your job duties + ties as best as possible to your desired field.

Your skills/strengths list is not focused. It represents what you did, but it does not build a narrative of how you can fulfill the duties of the role - they are a bit too spread out across different domains. In my opinion: Its fine to have multiple, but it should be clusters of specializations that reinforce your job bullet points. I personally would remove the generic ones and input ones that are more appriorite for your career level and desired field re: POS systems, HRIS, logistics, leadership, strategic marketing, etc. 

Its tough work but you will see better results with an optimized resume. Thanks for giving us a change to give you feedback",10

In all seriousness, our potential to do good depends on having the ability to explain to regular working people why we do the things that we do, and why following our directives is worthwhile *to them* in their daily work lives.

That said, protection for the class of race/ethnicity by US law as defined by the EEOC is not specific about WHICH race is protected. If a selection system is found to be favoring people of a particular race over people of another particular race, that EEOC protection could apply. 

This usually protects people from racism against minority race/ethnicities in the overall population. But the law ultimately cares about the discrimination of the selection process. If a selection process was found to be discriminatory against white people, they COULD be protected. 

Part of the reason people are freaking out about this is because... Well it doesn't really happen that much, as you might expect. Usually bias in selection favors white people, because of systemic racism in the US.

All that said, there's a lot of nuance to this as well and guidelines around what is or is not discriminatory exist. They are somewhat nuanced and do consider outside factors.

If this were a real case, there would need to be actual people that applied to work for this company, and it would need to be proven that race was a contributing factor in their non-selection for the job. In other words, if the candidates hired are shown to be legitimately more qualified, case for discrimination is a lot less strong. 

When she says she ""did"" this in the video, it wouldn't be great for the case, because it undercuts the idea that race is not an explicit reason someone wasn't hired. This is usually what companies rely on when their selection practices are discriminatory (racist or not) by the numbers. Someone who was worried about the EEOC would never say something like that and again, is contributing to why these weirdos are losing their minds about the video.

Since I've already written a novel, another thing to consider for this theoretical case would be the size of the company (which in this video seems to be a 21 person team, not EA). EEOC law would apply, but the burden of proof for discrimination would be much different than in a huge company like EA. Things like recruiting population and number of applicants would matter. And again, you'd need actual people who felt wronged. From what I understand, this game is an indie BIPOC dating sim game... I don't think those people probably exist (at least not in good faith).

FWIW much of this thread is you arguing in bad faith by downplaying impact, deflecting guilt, flinging ad homs, and misrepresenting legal concepts. The manager's speech didn't seem to bother you at all beyond its implication in a hypothetical legal defense, and one can only speculate on your personal opinion about anti-white discrimination.

I'm not aware of any case where race was found to be uniquely exempt from Title VII section 703(e), possibly because it was never included among religion, sex, and national origin in the first place. The EEOC had this to say in non-legally binding guidance CM-625 meant to clarify BFOQ's under Title VII:

&gt;The protected class of race is not included in the statutory exception and clearly cannot, under any circumstances, be considered a BFOQ for any job.

They provide references to a few cases under that text. I have not been able to find anything in them relevant to 703(e), again thinking this is because race was never included.

There is a carveout in footnote 3 of CM-625 (again, non-legally binding):

&gt;Although race cannot be a BFOQ, if an employer responds to a charge of race discrimination by alleging the necessity of considering race for purposes of authenticity or genuineness

It's my understanding that this would apply to free expression, where let's say you are hiring an actor to play MLK in a documentary. Not aware of any litigation around this carveout, however.

From what I have read across published articles, Congress did not include race as a BFOQ under Title VII because there was no need identified. But these are second and third-party sources.",6_1_1_1

An undergrad I finished a degree in interdisciplinary studies, targeted at business, psychology, and philosophy, as a foundation to my masters which I already knew I was going to pursue.

I have finished a certification and compensation and benefit package design, my SHRM CP, and Google's project management certification for funsies (but really to a structural process to implement my programs).

In addition to my academic background, I've I have completed multiple internships and contracts, within the fields of psychometrics, administration, an organizational  development.

Despite SIOP and other organizations reporting that IO psychology is a massively growing field with an average entry level income of 60,000 a year and quickly growing up to well over 120,000 a year - I am unable to find job opportunities within IO or HR in one of the biggest cities for IO (top five according to SIOP).

I'm a firm believer that IO psychology is wildly important, and very much poised to fix some of the issues that we've been seeing come to light as predicted by strategic business professionals from the 1960s and before (such as Edward Deming)

If you believe the bureau of Labor, organizations such as SIOP, as well as individuals within the field - IO psychology is massively growing and will soon be a household name. However, at least within the US, I doubt it.

TLDR;
I am passionate about IO psychology, and I'm happy with my choice even if that choice will lead me to having to start my own business or deal with other economic uncertainties - though I wish I had picked a better grad program (be wary of degree mills).

I would love to see more people get into this field, however I would advise against it if you are not interested and essentially being your own salesperson for weeks and years until you build a client base who relies upon you.

This is not a field where you graduate and are offer jobs immediately, or even taking all that seriously by a lot of these corporations. I think in order to succeed within this field you have to be passionate about it and willing to do way more than just office work. 

That being said, if you're just looking for a HR job or some other office work - And there's no shame in that - io psychology probably is not for you. I would instead recommend pursuing other more one-to-one degrees such as human resources management, or an MBA.

Even better yet don't get a graduate degree unless you absolutely have to, or are paid to so. In hindsight I should have pursued my MBA with a concentration in human resources management and taught myself industrial organizational psychology. It's not like there's really a field that requires a degree in IO >7",2

 There are so many job descriptions that involve training and require an I/O degree. Many I/Os in government act as research psychologists, personnel, or isds.

To support this at nawctsd... almost every isd has an I/O degree,  not an ISD.

If you are a person reading my post weeks, months, or years from now, go to USAjobs.gov and search 0180 in the bar to find personnel psychologist roles. Or you can search a skill like statistics or data to find similar roles.

Ive been meeting with a bunch of college recruiters to hear what they have to say and asking the questions I find necessary rather than solely letting them talk up why their college is highly rated. 

One thing I recommend (thats helped me greatly) is meeting 1-on-1 with people of an I/O background. Last year, I met with several grads via Zoom to discuss the pros and cons of the field. Many of them are actually working for college recruiting, but a lot are also working in consulting, HR, or management. I made these connections on LinkedIn and I feel like I got further insight on what to expect. Fortunately through my job, I have been able to make connections with higher ups so having access to them and asking questions has been easy for me. Still have more research to do which is why Fall 2024 is my targeted timeframe, but Im getting there.

Im personally interested in HR at this point of my life, but in the future I would probably consider pursuing other endeavors which is why I find I/O useful. I think one thing Ive learned along the way is that I dont have to have the rest of my life figured out in my mid 20s. One thing is clear, however, experience is necessary and good communication skills are essential in my opinion. You wont be successful with just being academically gifted and having the best notes. You have to try things out firsthand and learn from mistakes.

I can relate to the concerns and the frustrations from many people in the comments because I/O is heavily associated with HR positions for the most part when really theres more to it. From development specialization, management, to people analyst, there is a lot that can be done depending on each company and their values in the industrial/organizational sector. Googling HR jobs is overly saturated in my opinion, but Im also in a different place than a recently graduated individual. We all come from different walks of life.

I have considered getting an MSW and then an MBA, but after some real life experience and work experience (currently a supervisor for a nonprofit) I am starting to realize what I am into and what I dread doing.

I am optimistic about my choice because I consider to be competent and because I have done a lot of cross examinations between programs in the realm of psychology. Ive narrowed down my choices. I love working with people, but I also love the business side of things and how they work. I also have to be transparent in that I have the financial and moral support from my parents so that is a huge relief for me. I dont have kids. I dont have major debt. I can choose where I go from here.

Im not at the finish line yet (I havent even applied to a program lol) but I feel way more confident about my personal decision after meeting with people and hearing them out. If at all, I highly recommend reaching out to people with an I/O background and hear their story. Be nosy, but not annoying. Were all figuring this stuff out so lets help one another where we can.",3

Org-side jobs in general are fewer in number and offer lower compensation in the US when compared to industrial-side and analytics jobs. We're also in a moment where the I/O job market in general isn't great due to a soft economy and rising interest rates that have led to layoffs in the US, so those weaknesses in the OD job space are compounded for the near future. It's good to have a hoped-for industry in mind, but you shouldn't restrict yourself this early -- get a job, get experience, and then set a long-term goal to maneuver toward your ideal industry setting. 

Based on working with former students in similar positions from India, the application problems that I usually see involve weak/no GRE scores, a lack of quantitative/stats coursework, writing proficiency issues that are evident in the essay or test scores, and erratic educational/work trajectories that leave us guessing about your commitment to I/O. The latter issue may be especially true for you given your hybrid degree and counseling-focused experience to date. You need to tell a clear, coherent story in your essay to explain your interest in I/O -- what got you to this point of wanting a grad degree in I/O, what do you hope to do in the future for work, and how do you think that the program in question will help you achieve those goals?

My day is typically wrapped around process/system development.

I also attend meetings that hit on policy development, staff wellness, and recruiting and retention. The remainder of my time is spent managing a team of support specialists who act as a help desk and development for our database system. 

I am satisfied with what I do and find myself able to use my degree more and more, albeit I wish I could go full hog and focus on the IO topics and issues that plague the department (low morale, high turnover, poor retention, cultural alignment, high stress...). 

When I clock out, I am done. I am able to step away and focus on other things that I find enjoyable and valuable for my personal development, so the work-life balance at my level is fairly good.

Find people on LinkedIn that have positions that are of interest to you and reach out to ask for 15-30 mins of their time to discuss their roles, steps they took to get there, what their day to day looks like, etc. This will help you expand your network and learn more about roles/areas that could be of interest to you, while also putting you top of mind for those connections who may come across opportunities before they are posted online or made public.

If you are a monster about researching and want to have a research-intensive industry job, a PhD is definitely a good idea.

Also want to quickly add that even though it is discouraged, plenty of people master out of PhD programs, meaning that they technically drop out of PhD programs after completing their masters thesis.

Im in the same boat as you; I love research. My masters doesnt focus on research. In fact, theres hardly any research or stats taught at all. However, I was fortunate to get heavy into research in undergrad. 

I went to SIOP a few weeks ago and was intimated by the amount of PhDs. I felt excluded and that I wouldnt find a job with my degree. However, Ive also recently been speaking with a lot of PhDs who are in the field and most have told me that nowadays, with ChatGPT and the internet in general, a PhD is just not worth it. I can think of a few situations in which Id want a PhD instead (survey design, for instance), but this is the overwhelming advice Ive heard. 

For me, Im going to do heavy extra research learning People Analytics and R on the side and hope for the best. I think, if you go the masters route and want to do research, you may have to settle for some self-teaching on the side in addition to your program, depending on how your program is set up. 

I wish I could say more regarding job opportunities outside of school, but I have yet to learn that as well. Just thought Id share with you that youre not alone with this question and let you know what Ive learned so far!",4

I think this happens to a lot of people who go to SIOP with a terminal MS.  It's easy to forget that SIOP is an **academic** conference.  If you go to a conference for employee experience, org design, people analytics, HR, or organizational development (to name a few) you will not have the same experience - because those conference are practitioner oriented.  

This may be an unpopular opinion, but it's my observation that all practitioner IO jobs could and often are held by people with degrees that vary from data science, statistics, economics, HR, OB, other psychology degrees (cog/clinical etc), and MBAs.",4_1

I found and still find the PhD a worthy endeavor for the following reasons:

1. The MA-only programs I had been looking into all came with tuition while the PhD programs were paid for and came with a stipend (that I did need to supplement with some loans, but way less than I would have had to otherwise). I came out nearly debt free. 

2. The program I went to was small (as in just me and one other in my year- he was my I and I his O). Thanks to the frat-like initiation process of theses, dissertations, and comps, I grew close to my cohort. Weve all helped each other find our first internships and still act as references when need be. Ill note that while we were about 50/50 in terms of who wanted to go into academia v professional work, we ended up about 75% in the latter field. 

3. Between college and grad school I ran away to try acting in LA for a few years- turns out Im a terrible film actress!- but I was coming in with a few years sans academia and experience. The PhD program gave me quick creds that I was able to leverage into those internships and later jobs that I may otherwise have lacked. 
4. In the years since Ive been able to build experience so the PhD means a little less- but my colleagues still use it in our pitch calls (listen to her, shes the doc!) as a way to make a little fun while also doubling down on said team creds. 

In short, the PhD gave me a leg up in initial interviews and likely expedited my career trajectory. And honestly, while I didnt go into research, I much appreciate the ability to understand current stats and literature and use that with my now clients. Those grad school friends of mine who also went into consulting have found the same- we still meet up at our annual spring break (aka SIOP :)) to discuss!

Again, this is just my experience, but thought Id share. I LOVE my work, and maybe I wouldve gotten here another way- but however it happened, Im just glad I did!",8

PhDs typically outearn masters and I think open a lot more doors. However, this is entirely dependent on you: if you plan to work at the big 4 and apply to the same roles that only require a masters, you won't get the benefit of the phd in the short term. Realistically, the PhD gives you more depth require for advanced scientist roles.

First, you mention you love research. PhD programs are about research but more importantly, they're about publishing that research. You may love doing research but do you really love trying to get that research published which is the bread and butter of PhD programs? You may or may not like that. I would try to get some of your research published or work in a lab that is trying to get research published to gain experience. Secondly, what are your personal career goals? If you're interested in working in a high-level consulting position, a position requiring high-level statistics, or working as a psychometrician then the PhD will be valuable. If you're planning on working in a company or organization in a role that's tangential to HR, OD, or L&amp;D you may not need a PhD to excel in that position and the time spent getting the PhD may cost you valuable years of earning. While the SIOP salary survey does show significant differences in earnings I don't think that it's wholly accurate. Many HR, OD, and  L&amp;D pros not included in the SIOP survey make competitive salaries given their experience. My suggestion is for you to clarify what you'd like to do and gain some experience. 

Some background on me, I have a PhD, MA, and MBA and came to I-O late in life. I like the research I am generally lukewarm about publishing.I work in a boutique consulting firm and academia. I would not recommend that people pursue an academic career at this time because of the many changes that higher ed is going through (i.e. potential loss of tenure, lack of undergraduate students etc.) My general advice is to gain some experience and then decide what your future career looks like and work backward from that.",10

I studied abroad in London for 6 weeks and a part of my program was a Human Resources internship with a company based in London. My last semester of college I was involved in a practicum through the applied behavioral science department based around consulting for a local human services organization where I developed staff trainings and helped come up with solutions to the staff absence problem they were having. I was involved in a research project through the practicum as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just recently accepted the offer I received from UCF because they offered me an assistantship position that paid my tuition and a stipend.

Now, the safety schools I want to apply to are ECU or Sacred Heart University.

I am working to transition from my clinical background into the I/O field by pursuing a doctoral program. I am eager for the research I conduct to influence my practice and feel confident about how this adjustment would better reflect what I value within the field.  
  
However, I am uncertain as to how competitive of a candidate I would be, especially when applying to a program that encourages backgrounds from various fields.  
  
I hold a MS in clinical-counseling, completing a thesis instead of capstone. I was involved in a campus research lab for 2.5yrs. and will have served as an interventionist for a clinical research study for just under that time by application deadlines, this year. I worked hard in masters, thankful for the opportunity to secure a couple graduate awards and the GPA is clean. Some poster/publishing credentials, only not as first-author.  
  
My concern comes from having been told that I/O faculty would prefer a statistician/business applicant, rather than a counseling applicant, since faculty may feel it easier to teach a statistician/business background candidate about the field of psychology, than vice versa. Additionally, Ive heard that applicants accepted into an I/O program have heavy work experience with coding and data analysis. While I used R within my masters, I am working on professional certificates in DA to boost familiarity with a range of programming tools.  
  
Taken together, I would be grateful to hear what others in the field may think about the odds of somebody with a clinical background being offered an interview, as well as the odds of being interviewed for a fully funded program vs. one that is not. Maybe one of you has worn similar shoes. If so, what did your application experience teach you?

Used to think I wanted to do clinical psychology but my current project (a randomized pragmatic trial looking at the effectivity of two interventions to reduce burnout and staff turnover) has made me consider shifting my research from clinical to workplace. I did two years of research in my undergrad working on 3 projects: 1)using an app to measure experiential avoidance among latinx individuals who have anxiety and consume alcohol hazardously, 2)the effectivity of an app in helping latinx individuals with anxiety reach smoking cessation and 3) an online cross sectional study looking at how latinx cultural values impact an individual's health behaviors. As stated before, I now work on a new project focused more on implementation research within the workplace. I will work on this project for 2 years which means I will have 3 years of research experience by the time i apply to I/O (in this upcoming cycle) but will have 4 years of research experience by the time I (hopefully) start a program. Seeing as this is my first project focused on workplace wellbeing, i worry my other research will not work in my favor. There is thread among all my projects which is focused on health outcomes and wellbeing among underserved communities. My favorite parts of my research have been working with measures to create surveys (partially hating the existing measures in our literature as they don't capture diverse populations), analyzing data (although I only work with SPSS), and implementing research. I believe observational research means nothing if not implemented and as I gain more experience with implementation work I realized a workplace is a great place to implement my research. I have two publications as well and 3 conference presentations. 

  
All this to say, I am wondering what makes someone competitive for I/O as I don't really have much background in business besides the fact that I minored in business administration in undergrad but if you sadly look at my transcript, there are some C's in those classes.",17

We care a lot about research experience but it does not have to be in I/O. It's a bonus if it's in I/O, but it is absolutely not necessary. Most students do not have access to professors doing I/O research. In contrast, applied experience - at least at our program - is really just a bonus. For example, we would generally not take someone with applied experience and no research experience, but we do regularly take students with research experience (even in non I/O areas) and no applied experience. We do like it when you have both, but again, it's just a bonus.

Imo, one of several things may have happened for your friend: (1) this is not actually why they were rejected from all programs but rather they were told this by just one program and extrapolated it; and/or (2) they did not apply very widely, maybe did hear it from more than one, but have a skewed sample of what programs look for.

If you want a solid chance of getting into a PhD program, especially with your GPA, you need to apply to more than 3 schools. I am just being honest with you. Your GPA, specifically in business classes which I see as very IO-related, would be a concern. I don't really care if you got a C, or even a D or maybe even an F, in (for example) organic chemistry back when you thought you'd be a pre-med. But a C and especially several Cs in an IO-related course (or any kind of research methods course) is probably going to be a concern.

You should really apply to at least 5 schools, probably more. I know many people who applied to around 10. Most of these people landed somewhere. I also know students who applied to 4 or fewer and got in nowhere. If you're serious about getting a PhD, then you need to apply widely. Don't apply anywhere you actually would not go, but be aware that limiting yourself in where you apply could be the difference between getting a PhD and not. How important is it to you? PhDs are idiosyncratic in who they admit. We have great applicants get rejected because their best fit advisor is taking only one student, but 6 amazing people applied to work with them. Or maybe something changed for the advisor last minute, and now they can't take anyone. Both of these scenarios happened in our admissions cycle this year.",17_1_1_1

Ill tell you now I didnt  apply to many programs, but I went 3/5 with a 3.53 and one the rejections was because the PI was leaving (he told me this). Honestly, I would have to know what your cv looks like and see your statement to understand more (you dont have to send it or anything, just letting you know) to have a more completed understanding, but I would say that your gpa would be the biggest thing holding you back, but if its a 3.5 you should have less worry.",17_1_1_2

Â I'm certainly not trying to discourage you from IO! I just don't want you to get the wrong impression or to end up in a field you're not really interested in. Basically, IO isn't really as much about the impacts of the products a given industry produces, its more about the workplace itself.

The PsyD was developed in Clinical Psychology to address the shortfall of mental health practitioners in the US by creating a doctoral-level credential that focuses only on practice, removing the research skills that are the focus of the PhD. Practice skills can be taught in larger cohorts than research skills, and at much lower cost. This makes the PsyD model quite useful for addressing practice needs in society, but also *extremely* profitable for universities. 

As a consequence, we've seen this ""practitioner doctorate"" concept creep out into other fields (e.g., your high school's superintendent probably had an EdD in Educational Leadership or something similar). The problem is that the entire concept hinges on the idea that you can be a capable doctoral-level practitioner in your field without research skills. That arguably makes sense in Clinical, but it absolutely doesn't make sense in I/O, where many of your practice jobs draw on the same knowledge of quantitative statistics and research methods that an academic researcher will use. **PsyDs in things like Organizational Psychology are consequently NOT a smart option**; you will find yourself having spent a fortune and 2-3 extra years of school just to have the same skillset as someone with a terminal Master's, who now also has more work experience than you because they got out faster and started to climb.",21_1

No one can say for sure if your classes will count as that's generally decided on a program/department basis. However, I would guess that no, they won't count.

There are many, many indicators of quality and the standards are only a small piece of that.

However, where exactly are you getting your information on who is ""aligned"" with the guidelines and who is not? I ask because you haven't noted some of the programs typically considered the ""top"" (e.g., George Mason, Colorado State) as in alignment. Are you just looking at who says they are aligned on their website? If so, you should know that a lot of schools will inform their curriculum based on SIOP guidelines (or did so at some point many years ago) but won't call it out anywhere on their websites. Imo, rough alignment is generally a given at ""top"" programs; it's not necessarily something they address on their websites.

If you're looking carefully at curriculum and comparing it to the guidelines yourself, then I supposed it would a concern if something major is missing. However, I would still be shocked if you are somehow coming to the conclusion that George Mason and Colorado state are ""not in alignment.""

So, that being said, it does sound to me like you may be over-emphasizing ""alignment."" But perhaps I am misinterpreting your approach?

Also why are *you* concerned about the guidelines? Do you wat to ensure you are getting a well-rounded education? If so, then just review the curriculum and identify any areas you feel are important to you and/or may be missing. Or is there some other driver?

Given all this . . . should you ask program directors/admissions folks? Imo, no, because again this is generally a given at most good programs and it feels a little like you're trying to quiz them about details while missing the overall context of what makes a good program. If you have specific concerns about areas that may or may not be covered by the curriculum, you can ask about that, but I wouldn't just generally ask, ""are you aligned with the standards?"" Also, depending on who you are talking to (e.g., an admissions person rather than faculty), they may not have any idea what you're talking about.

The information on whether programs were aligned or not aligned came from their respective webpages. I want to clarify that not indicating (\*) some of the supposed ""top"" programs (note that I say ""supposed"" not because I don't believe they are the top programs, but because I simply don't have the knowledge necessary to know their relative caliber/reputation indicative of them being top programs) is not a dig on these programs, it's just what I saw direct from the program webpages.

Yes, there is some misinterpretation here. It's been about 5-7 years since I've done research on schools. Further, I'm attempting to research a specialized field and its associated professional organization with which I'm not super familiar. My ask regarding the importance of alignment to SIOP Guidelines comes comes from my prior experience in undergrad completing my BBA in HR. I saw clear differences between students' knowledge and workforce readiness at universities where their HR programs did not follow SHRM's Body of Applied Skills and Knowledge (BASK), versus my university which did follow SHRM BASK. But now thanks to responses [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/17s9e45/siop_guidelines_for_education_and_training/) and yours, it seems like IO programs being aligned to SIOP's Guidelines is something I can take with a grain of salt.

Ah, ok. You want online. I missed that the first time around.

Additional things to consider for online:

\- Who are the faculty? Make sure you can get some insight into what their credentials are. Most, if not all, should have degrees in I/O. It's a red flag if the majority do not. It's also a red flag if you can't find any information on the faculty. 

\- If the school also has an in person program: confirm that the faculty are the same (e.g., that they they aren't staffing their online program with adjuncts only despite having an full-time faculty for the in person program). Some programs are entirely separate from in person programs and have no faculty overlap. (For example, ""Purdue Global"" is - as far as I am aware - totally separate from Purdue despite the branding and therefore likely has no overlap with Purdue's I/O faculty. But you could confirm.)

\- Will there be opportunities to network in person (e.g., a once-per-semester or once-per-year event). Even an infrequent event could make a big difference for program culture and networking.",40_1_1_1

Given that my gpa was a stellar 2.7 (I know, I know), and I graduated 14 years ago, is there any shot I can even get in? I am very willing to take classes or anything that will help bolster my chances. Id be looking at CSU or GMU for online purposes.

Before I say anything, to those of you who take the time out of your day to respond, I appreciate it greatly!

Here's the thing: I want to go into HR... or so I tell myself. I haven't had the opportunity to get a role with HR, and my HR internship I did in previous years was for a start-up company... not the best representation.

I have been considering my options for achieving my master's degree and I'm currently stuck between a few options: I could go for an MBA with a focus in HR, an MS in Human Resources Managment (I am interested in leadership positions down the line) or finally, you! Yes, you! Industrial &amp; Organizational Psychology.

I've been reading that when it comes to the HR field, many applicants usually have either a masters in the field, or a certification such as the SHRM-CP, and not as many with both. Well, I am dead set on achieving both.

My question to you all: Would it be beneficial to have both the certification + a degree directly in HR, or to avoid redundancy should I have a broader degree (such as IOPsych) and let my certification (SHRM-CP) act as my specialization in the field?

My personal argument favors both sides, unfortunately. On one hand, the HR degree's I've found typically are built around SHRM guidelines (which I'm learning and utilizing with the certification), thus meaning I may have a stronger grasp on the HR degree's courses... but simultaneously I must admit a degree and a certification that teach the same material is redundant.

Thank you to anyone who has insight or opinions.",42

I/O programs don't really train people to prep for the SHRM-CP certification, and the people that answer the posts here (I believe mostly faculty and PhD students, occasionally master's students) don't have much insight on HR specifically. 

In my opinion (a faculty member in a PhD program; we don't offer master's) it would make more sense to get an HR degree if you are certain you know you want an HR position. ""Redundancy"" may sound tedious, but getting a degree in something that isn't actually what you want to do also seems a little misguided.

That degree name will forever be on your resume. Think about the people reading your resume in the future. What do you want it to say? What would they most easily understand as valuable?",42_1

Hey everyone! 

Thanks for tackling my post. These thoughts have been piling up in my head and Im finally getting them out. 

I'm currently on the path to applying for PhD programs with career aspirations in both industry and academia (a little more inclination towards industry). I'm determined to set myself up for success by making smart decisions early on. The last thing I want is to invest five years in a PhD program only to find myself (in my mid/late 30s) fiercely competing for an assistant professor position that pays the same as the sales job I left several years earlier (albeit more fulfilling). 

My (ultimate/ideal) goal is to bring my research skills and knowledge cultivated during my PhD to industry, making systemic improvements that will benefit both the company and its employees, all while securing a generous paycheck. Then bringing my observations and questions industry back to research in academia.

However, I'm unsure about which type of PhD program will best prepare and support me for this endeavor. Specifically, I'm looking for insights into I-O Psychology (IOP), Organizational Behavior (OB), and Organizational Development (OD) in terms of grad programs, career prospects in industry, opportunities in academia, and income potential.

From my research, it seems that OD careers in industry often involve collaborating with executives to optimize people operations, implement organizational change, and shape company culture, potentially offering higher earning potential. In contrast, IOP professionals appear to work more directly with individual employees, and as for OB,Im not too sure where those jobs are in industry. 

I will say this though, even though it makes sense (since business is where the money is), it still annoys me that psychology professors who teach within a business department (teaching OB/OD) typically get paid more than a psychology professor in the psychology department for doing the same amount of work. Thats not cool& at least for the professors in the psychology department.

Moreover, it seems like OB and OD programs may be more business-oriented within academia compared to IOP programs (OB being more basic research, OD being more applied). Ive even seen some OB and OD PhD programs that even allow part-time study alongside work, which is less common in IOP programs (from what Ive seen , at least).

I've also heard that within industry, the specific type of doctoral degree  (IOP, OB, or OD) may not matter. But if that's the case, I'd like to understand the differences in training between OB/OD and IOP programs, especially considering that IOP encompasses aspects of OB and OD. Do OB/OD programs provide better preparation for industry roles compared to IOP programs, which may be more focused on academic placements for ongoing research?

Please correct any gross misconceptions Ive made.  
Applications are really expensive and time is invaluable which is why I want to make sure Im applying to (and attending) the most appropriate program. 

Any clarity and/or advice you might be able to provide is deeply appreciated!! 

PS Thank you for reading my super long post! 


**TLDR:**
- How do doctoral programs in OB, IOP, and OD differ, and how do they train students differently?
- Does the type of degree (IOP, OB, or OD) matter when seeking an industry job, and what about academic positions?
-how do potential earnings vary between each field in industry and academia ?",52

You have it in the reverse. The macro vs. micro assessment of these programs is accurate. I/O programs are psychologists first and therefore more focused on *individuals* in the orgs than the orgs themselves. However, I/O programs send the vast majority of their students into industry positions and prepare them accordingly. OB programs (I'm less familiar with OD) typically aim to send all their students to academia and train them accordingly. They are unlikely to support you getting an internship, etc. For example, OB classes may focus on helping you develop a sense of what makes good theory in top journal articles whereas an I/O class will focus a seminar discussion on how these theories apply inn real world organizations.

For academic positions, yes, business schools pay more than psych. However, many I/O graduates can and do get academic jobs in business schools, so the degree itself is not the limiting factor.

Imo, what I tell folks, is if you're remotely interested in industry, go I/O.

On the other hand, what are your interests specifically? Your interest in OD makes me think you may be more interested in macro topics?",52_1

So It sounds like OB programs are more geared toward growing and training future academics vs industry professionals who apply research IRL. 

Youd be right, I am more interested in OD, researching/applying macro topics through a technology lens, so like &

- digital transformation and organizational change 
- how orgs approach digital skill gaps related to new technologies through training/upskilling
- strategies for managing large scale digital transformations efforts
-  the impact of AI and automation technologies on organizational structure, job roles, employee attitudes etc. 

With that said, Im not shut off to micro topics.

Then, carefully check the program websites. Many programs have finally realized that it's more efficient to post information about the faculty who are and aren't taking students. Some programs are also moving toward cohort-advising models in which you aren't applying to an individual advisor, but rather to the overall program with a rotational model that yields your advisor within years 2-3. Do your research and make sure that this information isn't publicly available before you reach out. 

If you find nothing on the website and the program admits students directly to advisors, then yes, I do recommend that you write to your target faculty. Grad app fees are expensive; if the person with whom you best fit isn't taking students, then you're probably throwing money away. Write a brief email to introduce yourself, express interest in the details of their work, and inquire about their availability to advise students in the next cycle. Include your CV when you write.

However, to the curriculum, a typical I/O Master's program will feature maybe 1-2 courses on training/L&amp;D, much of which will cover content that you surely know already after 10 years in the field. The rest of the program will focus on material like motivation/engagement, people analytics, personnel selection, leadership, and performance management. That kind of curriculum could be really useful if you want to move into a leadership role in a L&amp;D consultancy, or if you want to broaden your skillset to have more insights into the wider talent-management space. However, it's probably not useful if you want to deepen your subject-matter expertise in L&amp;D. 


Also, concerning Harvard Extension School: HES is NOT Harvard. You aren't getting the prestige, faculty, or quality of education associated with ""real"" Harvard. HES is a third-party partnership with Harvard staffed with adjuncts of highly-variable quality. (A quick Google search will yield a lot of people in consulting, finance, etc. dunking on people with HES degrees.) I don't know if the HES brand alone is valuable in your local job market -- maybe a Western degree with ""Harvard"" in the title is a big enough boost to be worthwhile -- but the quality of your actual education will be vastly deficient when compared to many other I/O programs from universities that don't have the same global name recognition.",59_2

This cannot be emphasized enough. You will not get an education equivalent to most other master's in I/O degrees in this program. I would also imagine, though can't say for sure, that a program staffed entirely with adjuncts is going to have very little cohesion or overall program support.

It's a degree conferring school within Harvard just like Divinity or HBS. The difference between HES and any other school is the admission process. In HBS, daddy's money can get you a spot but in HES you need to pass three admission classes with a 3.0 or higher. 

It's true the faculty comes not just from Harvard but from the area. I can't say that having a professor from BU, Northeastern, Boston College, or Brandeis is the same as Harvard but that's not a bad pool from which to pick. 

The reason so many people make fun of HES is because of its admission process and the tendency of students to be from a less affluent upbringing. So, I caution you against basing your appraisal on the quality of HES's students primarily on the rantings of Jameson Langston Bottomtooth IV, heir to the Bottomtooth salt mine fortune.",59_2_1_1_1

He is a naval officer who specializes in admin, eyeballing a likely move over to the HR field within the Navy in the next few years (and hes 9 years at least from retirement) . He has his BS in Psych, wrapping up an MS in forensic psych (a passion project for him). With both his long naval career in admin/HR plus his degrees, hes leaning towards a postnaval career in IO psych (likely within the federal government). Hes also leaning towards a PsyD or PhD program vs another masters. He would start, and possibly complete the program while still on active duty.

I have a couple questions:
1. Is it important that IO psych programs carry APA accreditation, or is the SIOP recommendation enough? Ive seen a few online programs on the SIOP site, but the majority were known for profit diploma mills (Grand Canyon, Northcentral, Keiser), and the ones that I saw was recommend by SIOP and has APA accreditation, has low graduation and licensure rates (Alliant, CSPP) 
2. Are there any reputable, recommended programs that are online, or hybrids with maybe a couple in-person intensives.
3. If it comes to in person, which school is flexible for working adults (military friendly is a massive bonus)? Im personally leaning towards George Mason, but im biased as alumni lol",62

The PsyD training model was developed by and for Clinical Psychology to address the practitioner shortfall in the United States. In Clinical-adjacent fields, like Forensic Psych, it's arguably possible to separate practice and research skills in a way that makes the practice-focused PsyD a reasonable training model. Conversely, in I/O, there is strong overlap between research and practice skills to a degree that the PsyD is a nonsensical model for us. Several universities do offer a PsyD in I/O or something adjacent, like Org Leadership, but that's a naked cash-grab and an enormous red flag for any potential applicants.

Second, licensure is a non-starter in I/O. There's a long and contentious history between SIOP, which is Division 14 of the APA, and the broader Association's stance on licensure of psychologists. The short version is that the licensure model is developed for clinical and counseling psychologists with the goal of defending those disciplines against quackery, which is obviously important. However, it means that other types of psychology, such as social and I/O, are basically frozen out from the US licensure model because you can't get licensed without, among many other things, thousands of hours of client-facing work supervised by someone else who is already licensed. So, don't worry a bit about licensure rates associated with I/O programs since most I/Os will never, ever be able to earn licensure. Program-level accreditation is similarly less important in I/O than in other areas of Psychology. Most information about accreditation that you'll find from programs like Alliant or CSPP is a bit sneaky; usually the accreditation being described is granted to other Psychology graduate programs in the same department (e.g., by the APA to an adjacent Clinical program) or to the overall university rather than any specific academic program (e.g., by the Higher Learning Commission or a similar body). 

Hybrid PhD isn't a model that has taken off in I/O, so the options are unfortunately fully online (convenient, but with zero good doctoral options) or fully in-person. The two ex-Navy folks that I personally know came up through George Mason (because of the proximity to DC) and Old Dominion (because of the proximity to Norfolk). I would look closely at those two programs; George Mason is the stronger and more stable of the two at the moment due to faculty turnover and some culture problems at ODU. Rice University in TX is also an excellent PhD option that has some ties to the Navy, largely due to the research relationships that Eduardo Salas and a few other faculty have with military funding. At the terminal Master's level, San Diego State is an additional good option to consider because it's easily commutable from NBSD.",62_4

You will already have an MS and a resume that is more than most as they are coming out of undergrads. Being non-traditional is not a liability. The only disadvantage I see is that you may want to avoid applying under very young PhD advisors because some of them may be concerned about being in a mentor position with someone who is much older than them and who, therefore, in some ways has more experience than they do.

I sometimes mentor undergrad students who are interested in attending schools in my area (DC). However, sometimes I like recommending programs outside of this hub just for the sake of flexibility.

One student has O-side interests and is considering I/O and OB. He was also interested in the West Coast. What part of Cali is best for I/Os? I was thinking LA area, but I have no knowledge of program quality on the West Coast in general.

I know this is my opportunity to explain my experience and why I will make a successful candidate.

For example, how much should I focus on my fit with currently faculty and my research interest? Right now I was thinking: 
Intro: 10-15% should be my brief introduction (I have to briefly explain my 10 year gap in school) and my why
Middle: 60-70% should be my experience and the skills Ive built to make a successful graduate student
End: 10-15% should be my research and faculty interest which should compliment my why

Don't follow examples online for med school, law school, etc., which tend to be too florid for psych grad programs. Your breakdown feels about right, but remember that the PhD is about selling your fit with a particular advisor or faculty. Look carefully at the program's website; if the program admits students with a cohort model, like Penn State, then you should pitch your fit in broad terms and describe *several* people that you're interested in working with at the start. Conversely, if the program admits students directly paired to a specific advisor, then focus your fit argument on a particular faculty member. (In the latter case, also make sure to write your prospective advisors in late August - early September to confirm that they are accepting advisees in this cycle!)

To clarify, PhD programs accept students with the intention of conferring a Master's embedded within the PhD curriculum. They don't seek to accept students pursuing a terminal Master's degree. That makes the comparison to a school like SDSU unreasonable -- both are really good at what they do, but they do entirely different things. Getting accepted directly to a PhD program typically requires very strong grades, meaningful prior research experience, and, in some cases, good standardized test scores. 

SJSU also offers a terminal Master's program and so it allows for a more direct comparison. I don't think that SJSU's quality of education is as good as SDSU or CSULB, but they're a popular option for west-coast students due to their proximity to silicon valley tech jobs.

I think you are wanting this simulation to be more than we designed it to be, or perhaps to apply to a use case you have imagined that does not match the one we imagined in setting up simulation parameters.

There is still a pretty sizable chunk of IOs using well-validated, existing psychometric measures developed to the Standards, i.e., they have been created with the explicit purpose of minimizing item-wise construct-irrelevant variance, minimizing any covariances between residuals and demographics/outcomes, etc., all in pursuit of tau-equivalent unidimensional psychometric measurement that meet conventional standards for reliability and validity evidence. This is the audience we conducted this for - let me call this ""classic IO.""

In classic IO, a question these folks are asked these days is ""why don't you switch your system to AI/machine learning?"" Putting aside the issue of whether OLS regression is ML or not, we demonstrate that the answer to that specific question is, ""as long we focus on composites, switching to more modern (M)ML does not gain us anything,"" with the caveat: ""if you're willing to consider the item-level, MML may be able to optimize on construct-breadth in a way that you definitionally can't do when modeling composites.""  I would say those both certainly reflect reality, given the scenario we've described.

For MML to be advantageous given that basis, we'd need one or more additional assumptions. Or perhaps a change in focal scenario.

For one, perhaps your measures were not developed according to the Standards and you have what would in classic IO be considered nuisance relationships (linear or otherwise), between residuals and performance (and perhaps demographics). If we imagine a situation where we don't care about interpretability, then advanced ML in that situation will certainly produce better prediction than what our simulation would show, because it will optimize itself on all signals of performance, regardless of whether they are construct-relevant. This simulation was not designed to speak to this situation.

For two, curvilinearities are equally model-able with both OLS and MML approaches. But I would expect gains to be proportional across approaches anyway. If your OLS approach had adequate sample size to minimize sampling error in your var/cov matrix across all of your interaction/quadratic/cubic/whatever terms, I would still expect it to be superior or equal performing to MML. So I think you're assuming a situation where that's not true, i.e., you have adequate sample size for confidence in linear modeling but inadequate for modeling curvilinear relationships. In that specific use case, I agree that MML is going to do better, but that is still the same conclusion we drew in the paper - for whatever you're doing, OLS will do fine if you have stable estimates of effects, and MML will likely do better when you don't.

For three, even in this situation, there are many more complex tradeoffs underneath and some big assumptions - for example, let's assume a non-interactive non-curvilinear 5-measure composite (5 predictors) all the way up to   fully cubic and and interactive, i.e., 15 main, quadratic, and cubic effects, plus 30K+ interaction terms. MML properly done will certainly produce a better OOS R2 in that situation than OLS will. But how many of those interactions do you really expect would add meaningfully/practically to prediction? Most likely, maybe quadratic and maybe two-way main-effect interactions will add a few percent to R2, but now we're down to a predictor set that OLS could handle best anyway at N=500. And if you did model the 30K interaction terms, MML in that situation would probably do worse in OOS R2 than OLS would have if you'd just cut down the dataset variables down based on your/SME judgment to achieve a conventional N/k ratio to begin with.

So the overall point here is that in most common selection scenarios, the way we *classically* engage in IO psych, MML is just not likely to give you much beyond what OLS will. A lot of our test development practices, and even our rules of thumbs, are explicitly designed to avoid the problems MML is designed to fix - don't model interactions, get rid of cross-loading items, get rid of items with highly unusual loadings, use a sample size 30-50 per variable for validation, etc.

The very practical outcome of that is that when people come to me and say, ""We've been doing IO selection for 50 years, we've got 4 to 6 measures we use depending on the specific job, and we don't want to look at items because our lawyers said it's too risky, so should we hire a data scientist for $200K to improve prediction?"" the answer is a clear NO. That may be not be the reality of your situation, but it is one I hear quite a lot, and that's who this is for.

And even with that audience, that is why we ended with the call we did: ""stop assuming classic IO alone is the best we can do!"" We are going to get *dramatically* better outcomes out of adding novel but thoughtfully considered data types - legitimately new information about job candidates that we didn't have before - than we will ever get by just recombining the information we already do have in ever-so-slightly-more-mathematically-effective ways.

&gt;I think you are wanting this simulation to be more than we designed it to be, or perhaps to apply to a use case you have imagined that does not match the one we imagined in setting up simulation parameters.

I just want it to support the conclusions being drawn in the discussion.

&gt;all in pursuit of tau-equivalent unidimensional psychometric measurement

An unachievable goal ultimately tested by gradient (close enough) rather than definitive tests which reflects the impossibility. Regardless though, I'm not overly concerned with the item level conclusions, they seem to be better caveated. Although treating the methods (ACs, biodata, judgement tests, etc.) and vocational interests as if they are unidimensional constructs comprised of traditional psychometric items is problematic.

&gt;curvilinearities are equally model-able with both OLS and MML approaches

true, but also curvilinearities != non-linearities.

&gt;And if you did model the 30K interaction terms

Many MML model these and the other self interactions implicitly without them being entered explicitly.

&gt;So the overall point here is that in most common selection scenarios, the way we classically engage in IO psych, MML is just not likely to give you much beyond what OLS will.

This is not supported by your study, your simulation is a pretty far departure from common selection scenarios. This would need some caveats to be true, assuming perfect psychometric properties of scales (but also of methods that do not have this same aim), with data gathered on a continuous scale with no possibility of range restriction, and assuming only simple linear relationships (at the item and scale level) between all predictors and criteria. You've essentially created a world that guarantees an OLS is not only sufficient, but ideal for the task.

&gt;That may be not be the reality of your situation, but it is one I hear quite a lot, and that's who this is for.

The problem is that the audience is not limited to this population. I realize its hard/impossible to write a paper for all audiences and am sympathetic on that front.

If this is also what youre taking about, what nonlinearities are you anticipating to be detectable in this scenario with MML? Or what scenario do you think is more useful as a prototype?

I do agree with several of your subpoints though - all necessary concessions unfortunately, in this case.

all of this is beside the point though. the point is that, given the limitations of the simulation and the algorithm implementation, the conclusions around predictive value are unsupported (or perhaps worse, systematically misleading) without heavy caveats.

yea the io lit has some limitations. in addition to the issues with biodata, it also has problems with how it summarizes relationships, correlation is just one view. mutual information would be nice to see alongside correlations.

But in IO, we treat items as indicators of a latent trait (i.e. locus of control, extraversion, self-efficacy, etc.). So, we linearly aggregate those items to a scale score. After doing that instead of say 60 features you may only have 12. At that point ML doesn't really have enough features to use to do any better than a linear model. 

For bio-data it depends on the outcome you are trying to predict.  But for something like turnover, it's usually self-report behavioral questions you'd ask. Like, how many employers have you worked for in the past 3 years. How much experience do you have working in the industry, etc. Then you provide options for them to endorse. There are typically 2 ways to score these. The first is rational keying, 2nd is empirical keying. But ML offers a 3rd way, which in my experience is like empirical keying, but ML can look at item level interactions that humans typically can't pick up on.",2_2_1

I had a succession planning job at the postal service (my hiring manager was fired 2 weeks after I was hired, whoops lol) and so lets just say I wasn't given a real opportunity to succeed before I was fired before 90 days. 

I was having a real hard time finding a job, it took me 4 months (I'm doing Training and Development now at the specialist level at a small company). I was getting turned away after interviewing for some HR manager type jobs and weren't even being considered for coordinator level jobs because of being overly qualified. I was really hitting a breaking point and honestly if it wasn't going having a very accommodating wife, I may have ended up having to move back in with my parents/siblings to survive. It gave me the opportunity to look for jobs, perform better in interviews, while finishing my Master's Thesis (it was accepted last week, yay).

I realized that I was relying too heavily on ""quick apply"" either LinkedIn or Indeed and started doing some jobs that actually required applications on their own websites. Although it was frustrating entering my information in multiple times a day, it was worth it and I am fortunate that not only was I brought into my current job, but they actually went 5k above their salary range and matched what I said I was looking for without any annoying negotiating. I took less than what I may be able to find in the federal government or roles at big consulting companies, but the position was recently created so I am the first person performing this role and I will be able to shine more where I am, move onto other roles down the road once I get my program functioning well, and they seem to have a culture that aligns with my personal flair. 

I worked an entry level job with Master's Level responsibilities during my grad program in the training and development office for State of Maryland so when I applied I think they saw someone who at least on paper, seemed to be pretty devoted to the Training and Development space (honestly it's not my passion but I like it enough to apply).

So I would actually think about how you are applying, where you are applying, as well as the types of keywords that you are using. Because IO can relate to so many types of jobs, its both a blessing and a curse. I have really honed my interviewing skills trying to get these 2 IO related jobs which of course helps once you get in the door, but I would not undersell the importance of really thinking about what you really want to do within IO, and not just apply for anything you could rationalize using an IO degree for because that does matter to employers (I would argue that it is also a good thing).",7

I used the question: ""What prompt could be used to generate a stereotypical image of an industrial-organizational psychologist actively working?"" followed by ""Generate this in DALL-E"" using GPT-4.

The question to GPT-4 generated the following, which I have complicated feelings about: ""A professional, middle-aged industrial-organizational psychologist with black hair, working in a modern office setting. The psychologist, wearing a smart business suit, is engaged in a consultation with a diverse group of corporate employees, including a young Hispanic woman and an older Asian man, both dressed in business attire. The office is well-lit, with a large window overlooking a cityscape. On the desk, there are various psychological assessment tools, a laptop displaying graphs about employee satisfaction, and a notepad filled with notes. The psychologist is actively listening and taking notes while the employees are expressing their views. The atmosphere is collaborative and focused.""

Once I asked it to generate the image, you've already seen what it created. I particular appreciate how the twins look bored and are both staring off-camera, and that one has an ambiguous number of fingers.

The network matters and the skillset matters. Whether its online or not is really a side issue. Living in a place like DC is a huge advantage. More IOPs in DC per capita than anywhere else in the world. If youre doing things online you will need to be more forward with your networking efforts. If you plan on living in a place that is not IO friendly and you do an online program thats two hurdles youll have to overcome that some of your peers will have an advantage over you. 

I will say this, the secret is out that IOP is a very good degree and very employable. This has led to a rush from many  psych departments around the USA to try to create a program - often because it helps support their other smaller psych grad programs. This has led to a lot of lower quality programs. What I would look for in a program are the following, in a touch prioritization:
1. Outcomes of prior students that are similar to yourself (that last part is critical) 
2. Number of faculty that came from reputable IO doc programs (no social psychologists masquerading as IOs)
3. Length of time the faculty have been there 
4. Course listing should include the following: employee selection, performance appraisal, psychometrics, two courses on org topics (job satisfaction, employee motivation, etc) - this is the absolute bare bones IOP curriculum
5. Project work in the classes - most of the good IOP programs nowadays do project work. There are three models for how this works. A) students have to finding their own clients and the report back to the class what they did and how it went. B) professors have their clients and select students to work on projects as they see fit. C) professors find clients specifically for the class in question and the students work on the project as a team. C is the one you want - it is also the most labor intensive for the faculty and this why its so rare. 

In terms of yourself, I would consider whether or not youre willing to move for youre career in this field (unless you live in DC). If youre willing to move for a job after you get your degree, why not go ahead and move for the masters program and do it in-person? If your planning on doing an online program and then stay in the geographic area you are already in Id be very cautious if its not a friendly IOP city. If that is the case, I recommend tacking into HR and you dont even have to get a masters (or even a bachelors) to get into. 

Just my two cents.",1_1_1

Employers care very little about where you get your degree from. They care more about the skills you possess and the projects youve worked on.

There is an argument to be made about program quality in terms of teaching relevant skills, but as long as youre getting the bread and butter topics, some stats, and some experience with coming up with tangible ways to demonstrate these skills (relevant projects), you can pass any interview for your first I/O role.",1_1_2

IOP make great program managers, operations professionals, chief of staffs, consultants, and executive coaches as well as pretty much all non-finance base roles that require an MBA.

Just a heads up the US markets right now are crazy and very uncertain for a LOT of people. We're in a bit of a recession and everyone is clutching their wallets trying to figure out how bad it'll be. This is exaggerated by the fact AI may be a viable replacement for many entry level job duties ( or at least it seems that way to may businesses even if it's not there yet ), tech layoffs flooding the market with very qualified candidates, and mass inflation causing many individuals to come out of retirement looking for ""easier"" work taking many entry level jobs.

I bring these points up to say the job market is blood competitive right now - and it isn't your fault that interviews are hard to land. Here's my advice as a fellow job seeker, so take it as you will. (Note: this is general advice ((largely repeats from what my mentors have all said)) since you're only asking generally.)

1.) keep **applying** anyway, it may be more of a game of luck right now than anything; but you can still get lucky. put your education section at the bottom of your resume - emphasize your work experience, and highlight what you can do that way. Internships, contracts, school projects, whatever. Specifically highlight what a job description says you'll be doing for that position. Change your resume for each application you're taking seriously, and write a cover letter that explains what you're bringing to the table in an engaging manner.

2.) focus on **networking**, connections never hurt and who knows, one of those guys may land you a job some day even if it's not today. this includes linkedin.

3.) if you need to get a job to just make it through these times, that's fine too. even if it's only tangential or not even related. I'm back to my old bartending job while leveraging the connections I meet there to network with local business owners - which has been surprisingly helpful, they've lined me up with 4 different recruiters and 2 execs so far and it's only been 3 weeks. Consider internships or contracts if you can find them.

4.) use this time to **UP SKILL**. Do not just twiddle your thumbs and cry about what you cannot help, optimize your situation. I've recently gotten my SHRM-CP and am working on learning about data analysis (without SPSS like a real business would!) as well as project management through google's certification. Even if I can't get a job now, when this shit blows over I'll be more qualified.

5.) Job titles aren't important... like at all. worry about the job description and the total benefits (this includes what you'll learn from the job). What job titles are good for are filtering down to find similar job descriptions on job boards like indeed (e.x. HRIS analyst is a decent fit for an IO, so using indeed to find other companies hiring this title). However again, many companies call very different things the same title as well as the same thing different titles.",1

Not sure if the same will apply to you or not, but take that into consideration - there are a TON of certifications in all sorts of things and you shouldn't try and get them all. Spend a few weeks looking into the ones that you think will help the most and run them buy people in industry to gauge their reaction.

Side note: 

I didn't take a course to study for my SHRM; in fact I spent most of my time reviewing law like the sherman anti-trust act which turned out to not even be on the test (fml LOL) most of it you should be good with an IO degree and some common sense. I found a reddit post about studying for it which has a live google doc with a lot of the stuff you should review that I'd recommend using (here's the reddit post, find the google link -&gt; i didn't just put that incase the rest interests you: [https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/eh8d2g/passed\_the\_shrmcp\_some\_advice\_and\_selfstudy/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/eh8d2g/passed_the_shrmcp_some_advice_and_selfstudy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) 

Take a practice test and see how you do before taking the test; or just run in with minimal prepping like I did and see what happens - at worse you fail, know what you need to improve and try again in the next testing window (which provides you time to study) -&gt; either way taking the test twice is still cheaper than a lot of the training guides.",1_1_1

1 paragraph job description giving an overview summary at a high level. Probably 4-6 sentences. 
Give the top 10-20 responsibilities/tasks/things you do in this job. 1-3 sentences per responsibility, but it could basically be a bullet list of 1 liners like on a resume depending on what youre talking about. Then top 10-20 KSAOs, 1-2 sentences each. Id suggest a 1-2 word label for each then a description, like Data Analysis Skills: Ability to interpret data and create insights from data.

There isnt really a right or wrong level of detail, it comes down to art/preference. If you combine a lot of responsibilities or skills into competencies, descriptions could be longer, but whether its a few big general things or a lot of small specific things, what matters is completeness of capturing the job (in general). Equipment/physical requirements could be a bullet list or a single paragraph for everything (e.g., must sit at a computer, be able to lift 25 lbs). Minimum qualifications can look like a bullet list from a job posting on LinkedIn or Indeed. It might look a lot like the KSAO list, so focus on education, years of experience in certain areas, and certifications if necessary. 

Good luck with this! Once youve done it once, you can add this to your resume. ;)",1

If you haven't already, I would recommend checking out Campion et al. (2011) on best practices in Competency Modeling, where they talk specifically on Job Analysis as well. There's also a pretty decent white paper that [SHRM and SIOP collaborated on](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/special-reports-and-expert-views/Documents/SHRM-SIOP%20Competency%20Modeling%20Documentation.pdf) that gives a quick and dirty view of what to consider. In addition to O*Net, I would also check out Competency Clearinghouse to get an idea of the different ways it can be framed and structured.

In practice, I've had a to make a lot of well-informed executive decision on where the cutoff should be. I've gotten around this in a couple of different ways:

* Iterate the work. I'd have a ""master copy"" of the findings in a comprehensive form, from the general core competencies down to individual behavioral indicators. Then I can pare down and showcase certain hierarchical level(s) for executive briefings/summary reports/reference guides/etc. Having that information on hand is really helpful, because it also gives me and the organization a lot of wiggle room on how to publish and present this information to the workforce. 

* Stick to the current organizational needs. For me, this effort is usually tied to a Learning and Development initiative that the organization is subsequently kicking off, so I know that they are really trying to focus more on covering competency gaps, which is really helpful in identifying the critical competencies for them to springboard from. So it doesn't always have to be a whole complete set in great details, it can just be informative enough to support future organizational functions.

* Work closely with the stakeholders and/or workforce to build it out by considering how they envisioned it. Job Analysis is a very nebulous concepts for people outside of IO. There is no right or wrong way to do this, and they are coming to you for your expertise on this topic. That being said, they can also be very vocal if they feel something won't work or is too confusing to them. Paying attention to those critiques can help get you close to a final product that will be well-received and something that they will actually apply later on. Of course, don't just bend to every single demand, because that risks the framework to become something else entirely and would defeat the purpose of this effort.",5

Writing a job analysis can be a meticulous task, but its essential for creating a clear and effective job description that attracts the right candidates. Here are some steps and tips to guide you through the process, including how to integrate the data from O\*NET and how an ATS like Recruit CRM can streamline the process:  
  
Steps to Write a Job Analysis  
**Gather Information:** Use resources like O\*NET to gather detailed information about the responsibilities and requirements of your job. Look for similar positions and note common responsibilities, KSAOs (Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Other characteristics), and equipment/physical requirements.  
  
[Job Responsibilities and Description:](https://recruitcrm.io/blogs/job-descriptions/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit+organic+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=011-HIKAnswer)  
**Detail Specific Tasks**: List specific tasks involved in the job. Be as detailed as necessary to give a clear picture of what the job entails, but avoid overly technical jargon unless it is industry-standard.  
Frequency and Importance: For each task, mention how often it is performed and its importance to the overall job.  
KSAOs:  
  
**Integrate KSAOs**: It can be effective to integrate KSAOs into the description of job responsibilities. For example, if a job requires frequently using advanced Excel skills, mention this under both the skills required and the description of tasks where Excel is used.  
Separate Section: Alternatively, you can list KSAOs in a separate section if they apply broadly to many tasks.  
Specifications and Requirements:  
  
**Physical and Equipment Requirements:** Clearly list any physical demands or specific equipment that the job requires.  
Minimum Qualifications: Include education, experience, certifications, or technical skills necessary for the job.  
Writing Style:  
  
**Be Clear and Concise:** Use clear, concise language that can be easily understood by potential candidates.  
Use Action Words: Start bullet points with action verbs to make them more engaging and direct.  
How ATS Can Help  
  
1. Using an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) like Recruit CRM can significantly ease the job analysis and posting process. Heres how:  
2. Template Use: Recruit CRM allows you to save job descriptions as templates. Once youve created a detailed job analysis, you can reuse and tweak it for similar positions in the future, saving time and ensuring consistency.  
3. Collaboration: Share the job description with colleagues directly within the system for feedback, ensuring all necessary details are included and accurately reflect the job requirements.  
4. Distribution: Easily distribute the job posting to multiple job boards and social media platforms directly from Recruit CRM. This widens your reach and helps attract a diverse pool of candidates.  
5. Keyword Optimization: Recruit CRM can suggest keywords to include in your job description that help optimize it for search engines and job board algorithms, increasing the visibility of your posting.  
  
**Example Using Recruit CRM**  
Imagine youre analyzing a job for a Project Manager. After completing your job analysis using the steps above, you input the data into Recruit CRM. You use a template for project management roles but adjust the KSAOs and responsibilities based on your new analysis. Once finalized, you post the job across multiple channels directly from Recruit CRM. The system tracks all applications, helping you manage responses efficiently and effectively.  
  
By following these guidelines and leveraging tools like Recruit CRM, you can create a comprehensive job analysis that not only captures the essence of the role but also reaches the right candidates efficiently. Good luck with your job analysis!",6

I have more or less been applying regularly to jobs that are related to the I/O field since then, and I have yet to get a single interview. 

I am a highly skilled professional who has always excelled on any team I've been on. I've built out and helped define multiple roles in corporate jobs, and in high-growth startups. I fell into the Business Analyst role after being unemployed at the beginning of COVID, which I've seen quite a few I/O degree holders get into as well. 

Maybe I'm missing something on my resume, or maybe I value myself too highly, but the fact that I can't get a single interview has been very concerning. Anyone I speak to says the job market is incredibly competitive, and hiring has slowed. 

When I first started my Masters in 2017, the job outlook for I/O Psych was in the double digit growth, and I initially got interested in the field around the time the BLS had the growth sitting in the high teens if I remember correctly. 

Currently, the BLS has the job growth of I/O Psych sitting at &lt;4%, with less than 100 jobs opening up between 2021 and 2031 - which is pretty abysmal, if you ask me. 

I don't want to say that I regret the time I put into my degree, because it has given me a lot of skills and information about how to be a better leader and colleague - however the rapid and dramatic shift in the job outlook for this type of position is really, really, REALLY hard to stay positive about.",3

The fully-online space is still lagging in I/O. There are a few universities that have built online versions of their in-person programs, like George Mason and Colorado State, and those are better options to consider if you *must* be online. (Being in person is generally far better from a learning, networking, and internship perspective.) 

[Look at the stickied posts in the Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/wiki/index) Where you go to school, and what you do while in school, has an enormous impact on your job prospects.

I also disagree about learning in person, as I am a prime example in that in-person learning is not for me. I've seen your other comments and some of your information is blatantly false. SNHU is not a for-profit institution, and it seems most of your points come from your own personal anecdotes and not true references. 

Your school and connections may have an impact, but that doesn't change the job outlook statistics and it doesn't change the reality that the field is barely recognized by HR professionals. I can't even select the appropriate degree when applying for positions that specifically list having an I/O degree as a requirement.",3_1_1_1

Securing accreditation from one of the many competing agencies that supply it is the lowest of low bars to clear for universities in the US. Yes, I am biased against programs that provide bad training to students, and SNHU is one of them. I have worked on program assessment efforts on SIOP committees and I have multiple decades in the field. There is no ""objective"" truth to program judgments, but I firmly believe that I have the perspective to offer a very informed opinion. Take it or leave it.

You are correct that the field is retracting at the moment because of the state of the US economy. Because I/O is a small field, small retractions are dramatic in terms of percentages. What this means in practice is that students who are effectively trained and mentored from strong programs continue to find jobs, but usually after a longer-than-normal search period. Students coming out of programs that are less competitive wind up in more serious trouble because small mistakes are deadly when there are more applicants than jobs.

I feel like a lot of people in the field like to say ""stay positive and keep applying for roles"", but I've personally been doing that for years. These are jobs that I am more than qualified for after reading the job description, with the occasional stretch application. I've even custom-tailored my resume to the point where I felt like I was re-writing the job description and still nothing. 

Most people I talk to say to get into statistics/analytical work, or into the HR/recruiting/generalist world. Neither of those fields require an I/O degree, and in fact the I/O degree may not even be recognized by the hiring managers for those roles. 

It's a very rewarding degree, and like I said it teaches a lot. I've been able to grow as a person and as an employee and get promoted in various roles. But at the same time, it feels like my time would have been better spent in data analysis or a more traditional HR program, with I/O playing a supplemental role.",3_1_2

Faculty - who are almost always the ones directly responsible for making admit decision in reputable PhD programs - do not give a darn about alumni donations. The reason is usually either a) we legitimately want students to get a greater breadth of experience by going somewhere other than their undergrad and b) sometimes we just say that so that people don't get their hopes up about getting in. We want them to apply lots of places and not bank on us.

The reality is, I might have a decent undergrad working for me, but an AMAZING applicant from somewhere else. Yes, I would take someone who worked well with me over someone equally qualified that I didn't know. But there's no guarantee that that the undergrad working for me will be my most qualified applicant, and I don't want to hurt feelings. It could also be that I can't take anyone that year (e.g., due to funding limits, I am already spread too thin, I'm planning to move schools or positions soon, I took two people the prior year, etc.).

Just about any non-academic, PhD-level psychologist will make 6 figures at or close to graduation. No matter what specialty you go after, a PhD will expose you to research, stats, presentation skills, communication ability, and other key areas to landing a well-paying role in the workforce.

I/O is generally one of the highest paying specialties, yes, but neuro, developmental, social, clinical, school, etc. all make thriving wages at the PhD level.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;However, I have seen plenty of people on this subreddit ask for advice regarding job hunting and it is stressing me out.

The simple fact is that job hunting is a skill that you're not always going to be taught at university. Many professors have little to no recent industry experience. There are plenty who do have the experience, yet they may simply not have the perspective to understand what breaking into the field is like in the present day.

The tool of the present day is LinkedIn. I mentor quite a few students and have several others reach out to me on LinkedIn for advice and general information. The students that I see nabbing internships and jobs very quickly after or even immediately upon graduation are proactive and very aggressive in their search. As in, they are asking about what they need to do a year before they graduate, and they're taking action.

This is not to say that the students or recent graduates on the subreddit are not doing that - after all, they're asking for help.

The main thing is getting some hands on experience before you get your degree. You don't need a full internship, although that's the best bet. You can have a somewhat relevant job in HR or recruiting, for example. Or, like me, you can volunteer for a week-long assessment opportunity or anything offered periodically, and that's enough to get you interviews.

A PhD-level I/O psychologist living in an area with a healthy I/O presence will typically have an offer before graduation. That's why the other main goal should be to be willing to move where the work is.

If you're living in an area without many I/Os, the same could happen; you just need to start reaching out to organizations before graduation and building connections with people who can give you the work you wish to do.

tl;dr be proactive.",3

More and more organizations are realizing the value in identifying and developing talent in a systematic and rigorous way.   


To answer your question with a PhD you should have no issue. I will say that not all organizations value a doctorate degree. Ive worked in several F500 organizations and most of my colleagues had masters. Ive noticed larger and progressive organizations that tend to focus on assessments for example will value the degree (i.e. Pepsico, Amazon, Capital One, Bank of America, J&amp;J, E&amp;Y).   


As someone just starting out, the most important differentiator will be experience. If you're able to intern or work FT while pursuing the degree, it will make you stand out. Most jobs require 2-3 years of experience and I would expect a hiring manager to select a candidate that has some experience versus someone with none.",5

A PhD is typically going to be focused on pursuing new research, whereas a practical degree will be focused on just that - applying those principles to practice. As a PhD, I would have had to work at a university to actually leverage my terminal degree. Id have had to teach and pursue research grants to bring money into the university. I didnt want anything to do with that. 

Im not sure if thats just an oversimplification based on my own experience, or if it applies to I/O psych, but its definitely something to clarify as you consider pursuing your PhD. If you dont want your focus to be generating new data and methods, either in the corporate or academic sectors, then be sure to discuss with your advisors to see which sort of terminal degree will help you pursue the career you want.",6

My outlook on that now changed a bit as I grew up and started questioning why people work so much etc. When I first landed a big girl job, I realized how messed up some of these corporations treat their employees and I was just randomly thinking of ways they can improve. One of my high school friends mentioned I/O psych because his mom was an I/O consultant at the time and thats when I started digging into the field more. I realized how vast this field is and the things I can do and Ive always liked the idea of creating strategies for companies etc., so I decided to pursue it. I didnt even realize the money aspect of this career path at first, but thats definitely a plus! Also, you can switch careers down the road with very little issues because you get exposed to so many areas within your organization, and you learn how to speak at a much higher level.

Its like the best of both worlds because you get to still help people without it being too emotionally taxing. Im not saying theres no stress that comes with choosing this path at all, but once you actually see your contributions and how its positively impacting your company, it feels absolutely rewarding.",7

If you havent heard of this, I highly suggest digging into it because its not your typical admin HR. HRBPs are more involved at a bigger scale within the organization. Just like you, I never wanted to be in HR because of how much admin work you do, and feeling like youre not really doing much besides processing paperwork.

At the very least, you get to learn about the legal aspects in the workplace because youll need this knowledge should you transition to org development or any other areas.

I thought helping people with their ""issues"" was great. But I fell in love with Org Psych after doing an internship. A few deciding factors:

* Money/Status. 
   * IO pays better than clinical, is more scaleable, and affects more people. 
   * You can rise to prominence in some influential circles.
* I love solving business issues
   * You tackle fun and exciting projects and the deadlines are pretty tight, adding to the excitement.  
   * I love combining that academic/researcher edge of nuance and detail, and that entrepreneurial side, by translating research insights into easily digestible morsels for laypeople. 
   * I love the practitioner model, where you're participating in a living breathing experiment (i.e., a firm/organisation). You're sorting the signal from the noise. But you're actually part of that noise/signal too. Mindfulness is key! It's fun!
* The human element
   * Despite actually being human-centred, etc., in clinical psych you spend 70% of your work time with, to be frank, and not saying this judgmentally either, broken/negative/hardened/troubled people. In org psych, you're generally surrounded with more upbeat people, who are pulling towards a common goal. I don't think facing up to clinical patients daily would be conducive to my long-term well-being. 
* I love people, at scale
   * One-on-one stuff is cool and great, and I enjoy it. But knowing you're improving the lives of lots of people at once is awesome. You're kind of doing military-grade psychological operations for the benefit of many people, the firm, and your wallet. Win-win-win.",13

In fact, our field even lends itself to learning about other fields due to our understanding of learning theories / retention, dedication to reading research, and breaking down complex tasks into smaller chunks. So no matter what field you find yourself in, don't consider IO a waste - I hope that you find your way back when this dreadful market clears up (i'm trying to make my way through by getting an HR job in the meanwhile).

I believe the parameters of what you are looking for are:

* What jobs am I already qualified for with no additional training / experience (please let me know if this is wrong because there are a LOT of 6 month certifications that can push you into other fields no problem)
* The job needs pay a livable wage, assuming that because you're in a city that's at least $25/hr - again correct me if I'm wrong
* Something in high demand right now, where you could potentially start within 2 months

I've been doing a lot of thinking about this myself since I'm in a similar boat, thought I'm more just stalling for time. HR is NOT the option right now, and I may need to find something else. (Not HR because there's high supply due to layoffs, and low demand due to oncoming threat of AI clearing entry level work)

The real problem is going to be selling the IO ""I CAN DO THAT"" on a resume without experience to highlight, but I'll leave that to you since I don't know your background.

What drew me to academia is the autonomy and being able to work with students and make a small difference in their lives. No job gives you more freedom. But it comes at a cost. The job is always there. Yeah, you get long vacations, but you spend them working because there is more to do than you can during the academic year. In recent years the journal review process has become crazy and hyper-competitive. Academic research is theoretical and mostly irrelevant to the world outside of academia.

No one should push you in either direction. Everyone has to find their own way and faculty should be there to support whatever the student wants to pursue.",5

Literature - look at the structure and format of the lit review: does it adequately provide a foundation for the study? Do you understand the theory underlying the rest of the paper? Thats a good place for further reading, but also a good way to get exposed to different levels of lit review 

Methodology - how did the authors actually do what they said they were going to? How did they operationalize the constructs of interest? Are there any flaws in the methods? Are they using any statistical analysis youre not familiar with? What experimental design is being used? 

Results - take a look at how results are being reported for different analyses, not only narratively but also in tables and figures. 

Discussion  look at how theyre presenting the results and the argument for those results - do the arguments work? Are they really supported by the data? 

Limitations - did the researchers hit on all of the limitations? Do you feel that the limitations addressed were actually limiting, or anything else? 

Further research  does anything here strike your fancy as fodder for dissertation topics? 

Reading papers not only helps you broaden your knowledge of whats going on in the field, but also how to execute the science process in your own studies. This process helps you gain an understanding of how to do research both well and not so well, probably in a more applied sense than just talking about research methods in a classroom setting. 

I cant speak to expertise or such, but I think there is a lot to be gleaned from reading a paper. Look for a learning opportunity buried in each one and apply some meta-cognition to this process  what did I learn? Is there anything in here thats new to me? How did this new knowledge change my existing knowledge?

Our value instead comes from being bridge builders between the world of HR and the world of data analysis and interpretation.

I was pretty aimless through undergrad and chose to pursue IO on a masters level due to a research assistantship I took during undergrad, not because I had a particular passion for it.

That said, the benefit (and curse) of IO is that it is so broad it's easy to find something in the field you enjoy. The curse of being broad is that experiences vary widely between IOs. You have academics, practioners, and everything in between. 

My advice would be to come up with a list of things you like from the field from most to least desirable. It can be anything from entire subfields (change management, employee relations, etc.) to individual subjects (R, selection assessments, etc.). From there, I would try to find jobs that relate to those things you enjoy. They don't even necessarily have to be directly related to IO. 

Once you've located the jobs, start learning about them. Where are they prevalent? What companies need these roles? What's the outlook for them over the next 5-10 years? From there, consult your classmates, teachers, or anyone else you know and inquire about the roles you find and come up with a plan to pursue them.

And remember, even if you can't land the dream role immediately (most don't), it's fairly easy to transition to new, more desirable roles once you have your foot in the door. Don't panic. You'll make it.",4_1_1

Sometimes you find diamonds in the rough like that though. 

The program I went through is called Dev10, which pays you $600 a week while they train you through an intensive program for 3 months and then gives you a raise to real money once another company takes you on.

The application process was tough though! About 5% of people make it in. First you apply, then you have to take an IQ test, then you have a behavioral interview, then you have to take a 4 week HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course and complete a final project (it's not anything business based, this is just to show that you can learn how to do coding stuff), and then you have a group interview to show how you work in groups. Definitely a drawn out process.

I found it very worth it though. I got paid to learn about all these different softwares and I know I will get paid much better in the future than if I didn't go through this process.

Unfortunately, the job market is not great right now, especially for tech. A lot of really smart and talented people got laid off because there weren't a lot of companies hiring (in NY at least, Minneapolis Dev10ers seemed to have better luck).

I probably sent dozens of applications and resumes, which I understand to be light compared to what most people end up submitting before they are able to generate any interest from companies. Keep in mind I had not graduated with my Masters yet. I ended up getting a non-I/O data job and was thinking about beginning the application process again after graduating in December 2022. Most of the I/Os I network with encouraged me to get creative and find ways to gain my own experience. So I basically envisioned exactly what I wanted to do and focus on and started my own consulting business. I learned about marketing, started building my network on LinkedIn, read books and took some courses in my niche area - team development and coaching, and just generally would tell people about my plans.

About 1 month ago, someone actually reached out to me asking me to do a training for their organization because of a connection we share. I was very surprised and terrified tbh because it became real and I finally needed to be the person I was telling people I was for the past year. But it pays really well and I wasnt going to turn it down.

The training Ill be doing is Saturday but Im fully prepared now and actually feel confident going into it. I hope it goes well, fingers crossed.

But all that to say, from my own experience and everyone Ive spoken to who has chosen the I/O route - I have come to two conclusions. One, I/O is an incredibly broad and challenging field to get into, especially if you dont already have friends or family who can help you - like myself. Most organizations want you to have prior experience but its tough to actually get any. And two, it is possible for almost anyone to find their place in the I/O world if they get VERY specific about which route they choose, learn as much as they can about it, network, and dont give up. There are opportunities, but it might take a bit of time and effort to find them. But once you do it can be very rewarding if you actually like the type of work youve chosen to do.

Thats my story and perspective, hopefully its helpful in some way and best of luck to you!",9

First, going through the publication process is good training. Second, having peer-reviewed publications is an indication of expertise. If you are being interviewed for an IO job by an IO person it can help. That said, you won't likely be publishing as a practitioner. I would classify this as a nice to have, but not a requirement.

Start networking right away. Your first network are other students/faculty, but take whatever opportunities you get to network beyond that.

You need all the academic technical skills that IOs get in grad school, but you also need to be able to communicate with practitioners who are not IOs. You also need to learn how to take complicated information and data and explain it simply.

There is a great deal of variance in the sorts of roles that IOs are in. Some are doing analytics and very technical work. Others not so much. If your interest is mainly in the technical, then you need to hone those tools. If your interests lie elsewhere, e.g., in training/development, then other tools are important.",2

Publications dont matter but research experience does. I agree with other responses, dont chase meaningless publications or waste time trying to play the politics to get published in big journals. Try and focus your research on the topics that you would like to work on once youre in the industry so you can talk about your research as relevant work experience.

I dont think the when or where matters for an internship as much as the what. So if you try to do an internship too early and are only able to find ones that make you do meaningless work, several years of that is much less impressive than getting an internship later in your graduate program where you can work on or even lead very relevant work (e.g., job analyses or validation studies). See my previous answer for how to be competitive for internships.

Networking is annoying to me when students reach out just because they want to know if Im hiring and first year is definitely too soon if youre doing that kind of networking. Leverage LinkedIn and SIOP and reach out to people you want to learn from. Tell them what you find interesting about their experience, give them a high level summary of what your goals and interests are, and ask if they would be willing to tell you more or act as a mentor and if they wont or cant, ask if they would be able to introduce you to someone else",3

I knew I didn't want to stay in academia before I applied, and I completed my PhD two years ago. I'm now moving to a team lead role in a consulting company. Some thoughts on your questions:

Do publications matter if you're pursuing an applied research career?

*Not in my line of work; only in very select situations that involve doing heavy research in the organization.*

How should you approach research as a PhD student if you're pursuing industry?

*Do high-quality research because you will learn valuable skills, and choose the kind of research that will teach you those (e.g., qualitative, multilevel modeling, measurement, etc). Don't obsess/stress about publishing, politics, paper ownership, etc. I've had some really frustrating experiences with people who are extremely possessive over data (that sometimes isn't really theirs) so there's no need to get involved in that crap.*  
  
When should I do an internship?

*I worked through the whole MSc and PhD. You can add value in many roles from the beginning, but make sure you don't burn out if you're doing research, classes, TAing, working, living your life, etc.*

How do I set myself up to be competitive for internships?

*I don't think it should be so hard to find internships. There are many more flexible, hourly opportunities that my colleagues have found helpful with their work schedule. And they mainly want to see that someone is knowledgeable, interested, and has time to do the work.*

How should I network? Should I start networking in my first year?

*Not sure with whom you want to network. What is the purpose? If it's to get a job with them directly, that would be early. If you just want to know more about what they do, then there's no time limit.*

Are there specific skills I should be looking to develop?

*Depends on the type of role. There's a huge difference between what a data scientist should learn and an organizational development consultant.*",4

A version of this issue is actually the case in essentially all knowledge economy jobs (i.e., youre always being compared to coworkers, so if your coworkers routinely work overtime, you look like a slacker). People tend to be judged primarily on their effectiveness and not their performance, and effectiveness is often causally influenced by time on task. Work more, so you get more done, and more people think youre a good worker absent other information.

The main way to avoid this is to find organizations where the culture is we work 9-5, end of discussion. Those orgs exists in all forms but are

At least you can go to a place that rewards you very well for it. I would personally prefer that, over going to a place that seems better but really ends up being just as stressful because they would give me less in return. To be clear, I work at one of the most intense consulting places yet we still don't work any weekends, we have some remote/hybrid projects, Fridays are typically lighter than the week, but you are definitely working way past 5pm Monday to Thursday. So it's 3/4 of your list, but it doesn't meet the 40 hours mark. It also feels like a much better work life balance than academia, where I didn't have dedicated vacation/holidays, I worked almost all weekends, and I tended to work until midnight many days.

&amp;#x200B;

As for consulting companies that stick to 40 hours, that will be very hard to find. Consulting is a client service business. Perhaps an internal consulting role or an HR position would be more appropriate, along with the government option. My SO works in government, and they're supposed to be done at 4pm, but he works later often (non IO role, but they have psych backgrounds). At least he gets compensated with PTO hours or money for working overtime.",3

Over 40 hours is discouraged. Very little travel. But, it also probably pays a lot less. There are tradeoffs, as with anything. Our clients are mainly federal agencies which is likely why WLB is more favorable - no GS13 is gonna be calling me at 3pm, let alone all hours of the night or weekends. Nothing is so urgent it can't wait until tomorrow.

That being said, there are a few reasons that WLB is often so atrocious in consulting. For starters, the concept of utilization v business development. Utilization is the time you spend ""making money directly"" for the firm - like project work where you are billing a client. Most companies will want this to be at or near 100% (i.e., 40 hours a week). But doing a project now doesn't mean you will have a project to work on in a few months. Thus, to keep your utilization at near 100%, you have to ensure you always have projects to work on, which requires securing new projects. This can take a significant amount of time, and if the company expects you to maintain 100% utilization, this means securing new projects involves going over 40 hours. My company for example has pretty lax policies on this, but juggling between active projects and BD, trying to ensure you never have significant gaps with no project, can lead to going over 40 by a lot if your company is more strict.

As others noted - consulting also awards top performers. Senior positions in larger firms can pay significantly - but the amount that make it this far are few and far between. The other option is starting your own boutique firm, but that'll require being very active early on to get the experience and network needed to successfully market yourself.

Also to watch out for - some firms will underestimate labor required of a project to win bids. Then it's up to the newbie to figure out how to come up with a deliverable that takes 80 hours in 5 days.",4

It has become a pop-psycology tagline used to drive clicks like authentic leadership. This is because the way ""balance"" is interpretated varies considerably.

However, work centrality, or the degree to which a person identifies their work with their self, is hugely important here.

For a person with high work centrality, WLB may mean 50+ hours per week. For a person with low work centrality, work may be an 8-hour interruption to their day.

Higher paying consulting firms (Gartner, Deloitte, Booz-Allen, etc.) are demanding because they charge top dollar for their services to clients that are also demanding. In turn, they tend to attract talent with high work centrality. FWIW, they also all have remote / hybrid  options.

So, the question to OP is, what does ""balance"" look like to you? If it's no more than 40 hours per week, no expectation of responding to emails after hours, no work on weekends, then a top-flight consulting gig probably isn't for you. But, that doesn't mean that there isn't a smaller, more specialized firm where you could thrive. It's really just a person-organization fit question that you've got to figure out.",7

Were in a pseudo recession in combination with a ton of job layoffs putting a lot of strong experienced talent in the market, and the onset of an AI with businesses will early adopt (which will bite their tails later).

That combined with the fact that no one knows what IO is, and that most HR professionals are trained on the job and have very little clue of what they're doing outside of the scope for ""maintain the status quo and keep the ship moving"" they're scared to hire people who know what's up for fear of being replaced and they themselves thrown into the meat grinder we call a job market.

I think you are correct that talent management is the main area where people care about psychometrics, in no small part due to the legal issues surrounding measurement - there is simply a higher standard there, so they want people who know what they're doing. You'll find minor psychometrics roles included in roles across most other areas of I-O, including L&amp;D, but unless you work for a company that *really* takes psychometrics seriously, assessment quality in L&amp;D (and elsewhere) is (unfortunately) often more of an afterthought than part of their core value proposition.

I've attended for several years an internal OD/Talent practitioner in a COE and what I take back internally (to HRBPs) are the trends on what companies are doing research and how data is applied.  It's fun to take back things like ""Here is how XXXX does their survey process, and they have the same challenges we do with \[insert typical survey challenges like response rates, leader champions, leaders questioning the data\]""

Compared to talent/regional HR conferences I've attended the keynotes are HIGHLY academic, you might get a nugget or two, but not much practical stuff.  There's inconsistency in sessions - some are highly academic, and some are very polished presentations on how e.g. coaching is being implemented.

If anything, you might think of this conference as an anthropological excursion into the brains of COE/ SMEs on the talent/analytics/ people side of the HR house, you'll come away with an appreciation for the pain points and better insights into how to partner with your COE partners internally and what frustrates them on the whole.

Edit: If you're mid-career, you'll be surprised how many students are running around too; this conference skews young.",5

Both have been in an ""internal consultant"" type role. The first job was ""IO-adjacent"" on a business optimization / org design Center of Excellence team, and my current job is on a selection &amp; assessment Center of Excellence team.

* My status as an IO psychologist wasn't highly valued in the first role, but simply having my master's and being dependable &amp; knowledgeable was definitely valued. And there were definitely projects I'd work on that were super IO-relevant as opposed to IO-adjacent, and my input was definitely sought out on that work. My current org definitely values me and my team as IOs, as well as the other IOs sprinkled throughout the org in L&amp;D, performance management, etc.

* The work my current team does is definitely important, and my boss does a really great job at presenting the business impact of our team's efforts to business leaders. There are individuals and teams that value our work much higher than some others, but overall I'd say the business sees values our work. I definitely appreciate the visibility and respect my team gets at my current role; my last job felt a little like we had to bend over backwards to prove our worth (but again, it wasn't an IO team and there were no other IOs within the org).

* I definitely feel valued as an IO, though I think ""feeling valued"" is generally more of an org culture thing rather than an IO-specific thing. The broader Recruiting Ops team that we're a part of, as well as internal stakeholders I work with, are always appreciative and complimentary of my work. The org has good comp &amp; benefits to boot.

* I have a great work-life balance. Both jobs were 9-5 jobs, with bosses and org cultures that aren't clock-watchers, so most people leave by 4:30. I'd say I do about 30-40 hours worth of work each week, with occasional slow weeks and rare long weeks. This definitely varies based on the field/industry you're in. External consultants at the bigger firms work significantly more hours and likely have to travel, but the pay is also a lot higher. External consultants at smaller companies are usually closer to internal consultants, working closer to 40 hours and are more likely to be fully remote rather than hybrid or full in-office.

It can be tough to break through initially, but I think as long as you're learning and building skills, you can advance in your career very comfortably, especially if you find an IO-friendly environment. I love being an IO practitioner.",2

She literally wanted us to draw out maps that showed how the theories related to one another and the overall topic. YMMV but we all customized it slightly to make it work for us. This would be easier as time goes on and you acquire more theories and puzzle pieces for that bigger picture.

It does really suck that the class time isn't spent on tying established theories to fieldwork, and a lot of that efforts fall on the graduate candidates themselves to work out. It's especially insane when you're assigned 40+ articles per week per class, and the expectation is to, you know, just absorb all of it and make it make sense.

You're on the right path with getting the relevant points. I've always felt that the rests were just nuanced conditions to make it work. 

For example:

* Goal Setting is essentially about offering specific and detailed instructions to the right people, but it depends on the leaders knowing who to go to and realizing their employee's capabilities. It can be tied to Training and Development. So one of the practical implications is, when developing the workforce in the field, is to not just look at the granularity and timing of the instructions, but seeing whether the managers know who their direct reports are capable of. 

* Trait Characteristics Theory details how specific personality constructs can significantly predict future job performance. It can be tied to Recruitment &amp; Selection, as it is very popular for employers to want to (but kind of not really) understand their applicants' personalities. But the nuance here is that it would depend on the validity of the construct and which industry/role it is being applied to. The practical implications here is to first ensure that knowing which personality construct the applicant tends to possess would add value to the hiring process, then selecting the most appropriate and validated inventories that measures those particular domains of interest.

I'm over-simplifying it for the sake of showing how it could possibly be done. As an applied person myself, doing things like this helped me get a better grasp of the course materials, and it's a common technique I've had to leverage as a consultant developing practical solutions for my clients.",3

Regardless of my personal feelings towards this issue; if you wanted to talk about using IO as a tool in the sustainability kit, I would recommend firstly looking into getting additional certifications and experience working with benefits packages to start. Leverage this to begin working in the compensation and benefits departments and arguing for employee needs under the point of retention and recruitment efforts. This is the small scale; once you've gotten the company to start seeing the returns from treating people internally well, start working with the OB/D departments to argue for sustainable practices to boost sales, revenue, and again retention / selection efforts (after all, who wouldn't want to work for a green company as opposed to not?).

If this isn't the path you want to take, you can also look to leverage your education, experience, and insight into the needs of industry &amp; labor to pivot careers entirely and work within community development and push for cheaper natural electricity access to attract manufacturers and jobs.

I think many IOs have a bit of an identity crisis: Most are clever enough to recognize simultaneously that the corporate practices in the developed world are incredibly damaging to both workers and the environment, but there are almost no career paths, lucrative or otherwise, available to those who would want to address these issues in their careers. And unions themselves tend to hate IO psychologists, in my experience, because our field has tended to be more pro-manager.

I'm new to the field, and with the growing public support of unions, I'm hoping we see more attention given to them. Alliger's upcoming focal article on managerialism and unions give me some hope that the topic might become more acceptable in the field, though. And if we can get that topic to be more widely discussed, that might open the door to more discussions about environmental justice as well.",2_1

Weirdly phrased question. 

What about this?

If you're familiar with climate crisis language, then I'll assume you're also familiar with the idea of Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions for greenhouse gases. 

Many organizations in the Fortune 500 have goals to reduce their Scope 1, 2, or 3 emissions. You likely work for an organization that does.

Figure out if individuals (executive directors) at your organization are rewarded for reducing emissions in your organization. If not, build a framework that does that.",5

The study of the workplace is fascinating, but sadly the application will (almost) always be used to help greedy corps squeeze a few dollars out of their employees while screwing over society in general. Sadly IO psychologist have a fiduciary responsibility to help the fat cat capitalists, not the people they study.

I am glad there are some IO psychologists that are altruistic field, but this post has made it plainly clear that I made the right choice. If you actually want to help society as an IO, youre going to have an uphill battle.

Still, thanks for fighting the good fight and I wish you the best of luck.",6

Train people not to pollute, such as ""give a hoot don't pollute""? that had moderate effects I suppose. Then what is your ROI from such a program?

You are going to ""consult"" with businesses on sustainability? Sure that'll raise their esg score but that's about it.

You being in IO should be extremely familiar with the publication crisis, how are you so confident in the current literature?
